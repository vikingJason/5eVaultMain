In a **lightly obscured** area, such as **dim light**, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have **[[Advantage and Disadvantage|disadvantage]]** on [[Wisdom]] ([[Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area—such as **darkness**, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the **[[blinded]]** condition.

**Darkvision** enables a character to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light. In darkness, at least some light is necessary for dark vision to function. If the light is dim enough as to be very near darkness, a character's darkvision may be limited in the DM's discretion.

**Blindsight** enables a creature to perceive their surroundings as well as a sighted creature yet without using visual senses. Senses that could contribute to a creature's overall blindsight included enhanced hearing, an acute sense of smell, sensitivity to vibrations, or such specialized senses as echolocation. Because the sense of sight is not involved, a creature with blindsight is not hindered by such spell effects as [[invisibility]] or [[darkness]].

**Truesight** enables a creature to see in normal and magical Darkness, see [[Invisible]] Creatures and Objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on [[Saving Throws]] against them, and perceives the original form of a Shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic out to a specific range. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.


**EQUIPMENT**

**Torch** - A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.

**Lantern, Bullseye** - A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.

**Lantern, Hooded** - A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

**Candle** - For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
