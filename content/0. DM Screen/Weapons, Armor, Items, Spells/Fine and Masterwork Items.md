# Fine and Masterwork

Some weapons and armor are crafted with extreme skill, often as the crowning accomplishment of a craftsperson’s life. These pieces are visually distinctive and cost more than similar items of lower quality.

Typically, only masterwork items are enchanted, as flimsier pieces tend to not be able to withstand the magical forces—a fine item can become a magic item of up to uncommon rarity, and a masterwork item can become a magic item of up to any rarity.

When purchasing or commissioning a masterwork item, work with the DM to determine what it looks like, who made it, and how it could be enchanted in future. 

- A fine item always costs at least full price plus either 50% of the full price or 25 gold, whichever is greater.
- A masterwork item costs at least full price plus either 100% of the full price or 125 gold, whichever is greater.

An item must be originally created as a fine or masterwork item; it cannot be upgraded to a higher quality level.
