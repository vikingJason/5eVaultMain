# Weapons

Your class grants proficiency with certain weapons, representing the weapons you have been trained to use. Different weapons deal different amounts of damage, have different properties, and can be used to attack from different ranges. Melee weapons are held or thrown, while ranged weapons propel ammunition great distances. When making an attack with a weapon, you add either your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the roll, depending on the weapon’s type, as well as your proficiency bonus, if applicable. 

**Simple Weapons.** All NPC humanoids are proficient with simple weapons, and adventurers are able to wield most of them (if not all). The list of simple melee weapons include the club, dagger, handaxe, greatclub, mace, quarterstaff, sickle, and spear, and simple ranged weapons include the blowgun, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and sling.In addition to being noted in its properties, a simple weapon is also marked with S.

**Martial Weapons.** Martial weapons are more complicated to use and require training to be proficient with. You must be proficient with a weapon to gain your proficiency bonus on attack rolls made with it. Unless noted otherwise, the weapons in this chapter are considered martial weapons.

**Rare Weapons.** Unless a trait or feature grants it, you can only gain proficiency with a rare weapon by training during downtime. Depending on the campaign setting and at the Narrator’s discretion, some rare weapons may be considered martial weapons or they may not exist at all.

## **Weapon Attacks**

All creatures are proficient with their natural weapons and unarmed strikes. Unless otherwise noted, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + Strength modifier. Attacks made with natural weapons and unarmed strikes are considered to be melee weapon attacks, and a thrown weapon is considered to be a ranged weapon attack. Creatures have a reach of 5 feet with their melee weapon attacks, though larger creatures may have greater reach.

## Melee Weapons

Adventurers use a wide variety of weapons in hand-to-hand combat. The table below indicates some of the most common melee weaponry, though different cultures name weapons differently, and some weapons are completely unique (see Cultural Weapons). If you want to use a weapon not listed here, see the Customizing Armaments section later in this chapter. A melee weapon uses your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. Unless otherwise noted, melee weapon attacks have a reach of 5 feet. Creatures larger than Medium size may have greater reach.

## Ranged Weapons

Ranged weapons require ammunition to use. If you use a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, it is treated as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to be used in this way. A ranged weapon uses your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls.


|**Damage Die**|**Cost**|**Weight**|**Properties**|**Damage Type**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**1d4**|   |   |   |   |

### Ammunition

Ranged weapons require ammunition to fire. Typically that ammunition is made from bone, bronze, iron, steel, or wood; sling pellets are usually stone or metal. However at the Narrator’s discretion, special ammunition may be available.

**Explosive.** An attack made with explosive ammunition cannot benefit from expertise dice and can only hit targets within its normal range, but on a hit it deals an extra 1d6 thunder damage. 

**Flaming.** This ammunition can be lit as a bonus action. A weapon firing this ammunition can only hit targets within its normal range, but on a hit it deals an extra 1d4 fire damage.

**Punching.** On a critical hit, this ammunition decreases an armored target’s Armor Class by 1. This cannot reduce the target’s Armor Class to less than 10 + its Dexterity modifier. 


|**Ammunition**|**Cost**|**Weight**|
|---|---|---|
|Arrows (20)|1 gp|1 lb.|
|Blowgun needles (50)|1 gp|1 lb.|
|Crossbow bolts (20)|1 gp|1 ½ lbs.|
|Firearm bullets (10)|10 gp|1 ½ lbs.|
|Sling bullets (20)|4 cp|1 ½ lbs.|
|Explosive arrows (4)|80 gp|½ lb.|
|Flaming arrows (4)|60 gp|½ lb.|

## Miscellaneous Weapons and Accessories

Some weapons have special properties unique to them.

|**Weapon**|**Cost**|**Weight**|**Properties**|**Damage**|**Special Properties**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Garrotte|3 sp|—|Two-handed|None (see description)|When wielding a garrotte, you may make a melee weapon attack at [disadvantage](https://a5e.tools/node/137 "Click to view a local node.") against a Large or smaller creature that requires air to breathe. On a hit, the creature is [grappled](https://a5e.tools/node/642 "Click to view a local node.") and begins to [suffocate](https://a5e.tools/rules/environment "Click to view a local node.") .|

<br>

## Improvised Weapons

Sometimes you won’t have your weapons ready at hand. An improvised weapon includes a tankard, a wagon tongue, or a dead (or alive!) creature that you can lift and wield as a weapon. At the Narrator’s discretion, an improvised weapon that is similar to a weapon with the simple property may be treated as a simple weapon. For example, the leg of a table might be used as a club. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage of a type determined by the Narrator. Improvised thrown weapons have a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet. 

<br>



## Cultural Weapons

Many weapons have equivalents in various cultures, both in the real world and in fantasy campaign settings. Below is a selection of weapons from different cultures which you may choose to include in your game, along with notes on how they are represented in Level Up. Availability of these weapons is at the discretion of the Narrator.

**Boomerang** (Aboriginal, 5 silver). There are many forms of boomerang. This club has the thrown property (range 100/300), and cannot be used as a melee weapon. A boomerang designed to flush out or distract prey goes a shorter distance (range 50/150), but on a miss it returns to the location it was thrown from at the end of the turn.

**Butterfly Sword** (Chinese, 20 gold). These use the statistics of shortswords, and are usually wielded in pairs. They have the dual-wielding property.

**Dao** (Chinese, 20 gold). A curved broadsword that uses the statistics of a scimitar.

**Hooked Hammer** (Gnomish, 15 gold). This uses the statistics of a small warhammer which does 1d6 bludgeoning or piercing damage and has the trip property.

**Khopesh** (Egyptian, 1 gold). This sickle-shaped sword uses the statistics of a scimitar.

**Kusarigama** (Japanese, 10 gold). This is a sickle on a chain. It uses the statistics of a sickle that weighs 5 pounds and has the dual-wielding, parrying immunity, reach (10 ft.), and two-handed properties.

**Labrys** (Greek, 10 gold). This ornate weapon uses the statistics of a battleaxe. It has two blades, one on each side of the haft.

**Machahuitl** (Aztec, 30 gold). This club with embedded obsidian blades functions as a fine longsword.

**Main-Gauche** (European, 4 gold). This parrying dagger may be used as a dagger or as a light shield.

**Nine-Section Whip** (Chinese, 15 gold). This whip deals 1d6 slashing damage.

**Nunchaku** (Okinawan, 1 gold). This weapon uses the statistics of a club, but is considered a double weapon.

**Rungu** (Zambian, 3 silver). This club has the thrown property (range 30/150).

**Shuriken** (Japanese, 3 silver). This weapon uses the statistics of a throwing dagger. It can only do 1 damage in melee. It has the quickdraw property.

**Slingstaff** (Halfling, 1 gold). This weapon can be used as a quarterstaff or as a sling.

**Wakizashi** (Japanese, 15 gold). This blade uses the statistics of a shortsword.

**Wooden Stake** (Any, 0 gold). This simple weapon uses the statistics of a dagger, but any vampire reduced to 0 hit points with it is permanently destroyed. It is made of wood.

<br>

## Rare Weapons
### Rare Melee Weapons

Most rare melee weapons are secretive, meant to be concealed or utilize a hidden advantage to take foes by surprise. 

**Assassin’s Gauntlet and Boot Dagger.** At a glance this item seems to be perfectly typical, but it conceals a spring-loaded blade deployed by pressing a switch when it is used to make an attack. A creature observing it only realizes that the item is a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the weapon is being worn at the time and not deployed). Once deployed, a bonus action is required to sheathe the blade. You gain an expertise die on your attack roll when you deploy this weapon as part of an attack against a target that is unaware you have it.

**Double Weapon.** Wielded not unlike a quarterstaff, each side of this weapon has a blade, weighted head, or other injurious implement. Most double weapons are two-bladed swords or double-axes, but there have been gnome warriors known to wield hooked hammers and elvish clades specialized in swordspears. Double weapons use the statistics for whichever weapon is used to attack and are considered to have the dual-wielding and parrying properties.

**Mercurial Maul.** The liquid metal inside of the shaft and head of this weapon makes it difficult to wield but all the deadlier in expert hands. The minimum result on a damage die rolled with this weapon is a 2.

**Ring Blade.** This metal hoop has sharpened edges that make it deadly whether thrown or used in hand. In addition, when you throw this weapon, you may make the attack with disadvantage, and on a hit it returns to your hand. 

**Shields.** At the Narrator’s discretion, shields may be treated as rare weapons to gain proficiency with them for attack rolls.

**Sword Pistol.** When this weapon is used to hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to fire the gun in the handle, gaining a 1d6 expertise die on an immediate ranged weapon attack against the same target.

<br>

### Rare Ranged Weapons

Ranged rare weapons require ammunition to use, although some firearms can hold multiple bullets at a time.

**Geared Slingshot.** Constructed much like a crossbow, this shoulder-mounted weapon bears a striking resemblance to a miniature catapult. It is typically used to fire hand-sized rocks but any Tiny object can be used as ammunition instead.

**Ratcheting Crossbow.** This crossbow has a large winding wheel affixed to its drawstring which feeds into extra machinery along the stock that catches and pulls the string back again after it is fired. Winding a ratcheting crossbow for a single bolt requires a bonus action or action, and it can be wound to prepare two bolts. Masterwork ratcheting crossbows can be prepared to fire up to four bolts or be constructed smaller (with statistics like a hand crossbow).

**Revolver.** A revolver can be used to make one ranged attack per bullet loaded into it and requires an action to reload.

**Shotgun.** When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with advantage, the attack becomes a critical hit if both d20 rolls would result in a hit. When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with disadvantage and only one attack roll would result in a hit, you instead deal 1d4 piercing damage (adding no bonuses to damage from ability score modifiers or enchantments)

## Weapon Properties

All weapons may deal the same basic types of damage, but they also have special properties that make each unique. You can only benefit from properties marked with † if you are proficient with the weapon.

**Breaker.** This weapon deals double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis after this property.   

**Compounding.** You use only your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Defensive.** This weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.

**Dual-Wielding**. This weapon is designed to be wielded in concert with another weapon. When wielding another weapon in your main hand that does not have the heavy property, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with this weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting). 

**Finesse.** You may choose to use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Hand-Mounted.** This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage made to resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket, using thieves’ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen components.

**Heavy.** This weapon is too large for Small creatures to use effectively. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. 

**Loading.** This weapon must be loaded before it can be used. You may only make one attack with a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. 

**Mounted.** This weapon deals the damage listed in parenthesis when you are wielding it while mounted.

**Parrying.** When you are wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while [[incapacitated]], [[paralyzed]], [[restrained]], or [[stunned]].

**Parrying Immunity.** Attacks with this weapon ignore the parrying property and Armor Class bonuses from shields.

**Range.** This weapon fires ammunition. The range lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range.

**Reach.** This weapon can be used to make attacks against targets within 10 feet. If a weapon has a longer reach, it is stated in parentheses after this property.

**Simple.** This weapon can be used with very little skill or training, and all creatures gain proficiency with it.

**Thrown.** This weapon can be thrown as a ranged weapon attack. The thrown property lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal thrown range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range. Additionally, when using this weapon to make a ranged weapon attack, you may choose to use your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage roll.

**Trip.** When used with a combat manoeuvre that trips a creature or the Knockdown attack, this weapon add +1 to your roll. If the target is mounted, it adds +2.

**Two-Handed.** You must use two hands to wield this weapon.

**Versatile.** This weapon may be wielded with one or both hands. If wielded with both hands, it deals the damage listed in parentheses.

**Vicious.** A vicious weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17–20).
