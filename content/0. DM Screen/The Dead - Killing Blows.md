|   1   | As the body collapses, a limb goes flying, causing another foe to duck or be hit                           |
|   2   | As you double-slash your foe's abdomen, he drops what he has to hold in his remaining lifeblood            |
|   3   | As the foe's spine gives way, his body slumps around his bones                                             |
|   4   | As you pierce his neck and head, your foe's eyes roll wide, his arms flail, and he falls fast to the floor |
|   5   | Blood and teeth go spraying in a cone from behind the opponent                                             |
|   6   | The blow shatters your foe's hand down to a jagged stump; his only weapon now is splintered bone           |
|   7   | Caving into the foe's leg and foot, bone bursts through his boot; he topples like a sack of wet mash       |
|   8   | The creature flails the stump of his limb about is if it could regrow anew while his life fades            |
|   9   | Crunching noises pervade the air as your blow sinks heavily into your foe's cranium                        |
|   10  | Cursing the gods as he slumps over, your foe reaches inside the wound to hold in his innards               |
|   11  | Disbelief and confusion crosses the face of your foe even as he gurgles blood and falls limp               |
|   12  | Fists of rage suddenly open as your foe's veins fail, releasing his maroon mess to the ground              |
|   13  | Foe's arms fly wide as he realizes his mortal time is at an end, and falls backward in a bloodpool         |
|   14  | Foe drops everything and collapses, shuddering and dying from shock and blood loss                         |
|   15  | Foe's face is no more, his nose and eyes driving into the far reaches of his skull                         |
|   16  | Foe quivers in a macabre dance of agony as its body slowly ceases to function                              |
|   17  | Foe releases an uncharacteristic high-pitched scream as he dies before hitting the ground                  |
|   18  | Foe spins from the force of the attack, sending an arc of crimson across nearby combatants                 |
|   19  | Force of your attack doubles your opponent over, his head cracking open on the ground                      |
|   20  | Gritting away the pain with a look of defiance, your foe slowly slides to the ground in his own juices     |
|   21  | The head and neck sink into the torso as an overhead chop sends the foe immediately to the floor           |
|   22  | In wide-eyed horror your foe grips the weapon still protruding from his torso, and falls                   |
|   23  | Lifeblood spills on the ground, causing your fallen foe to trip on his own entrails in his death throes    |
|   24  | The lower jaw of your opponent is shattered; wide-eyed pain and despair ride his corpse down               |
|   25  | The multiple cracking of ribs accompanies the grimace on the face of your foe as he falls                  |
|   26  | Nearby foes nearly fall from the slippery, shattered mass your foe has become from your final blow         |
|   27  | Sanguine display showers the area as your foe quakes and topples over limp                                 |
|   28  | A tremendous thud accompanies the blow into your foe's torso, followed by a gurgle and a wretch            |
|   29  | You are awash in the remains of your foe, breaking the mortal cage which once held him together            |
|   30  | You are sprayed with blood as your wide-eyed foe emptily grabs the wound to prevent his death              |
|   31  | You sweep the legs out from under your foe, rending them and dropping his remains flat                     |
|   32  | Your awesome hit sends your foe somersaulting backward as teeth fly through the air                        |
|   33  | Your blow cleaves full into your foe's stomach, lifting him into the air                                   |
|   34  | Your blow nearly rends your foe in twain as he releases a curdling scream and falls backward               |
|   35  | Your blow sinks into flesh and bone alike; a muffled crunching sound echoes from the foe's maw             |
|   36  | Your blow takes the leg out from under the victim as his body collapses downward into a mass               |
|   37  | You cleave a limb and sink deep into his torso and your foe dies instantly from blood loss and shock       |
|   38  | Your foe bites his own tongue off from the demonic pain heaped upon him by your true blow                  |
|   39  | Your weapon slides through your foe to the hilt; you kick him off your weapon into a quivering pile        |
|   40  | The wound is clean, but a moment later in horror the foe gasps up a gallon of blood, drowning in it        |
