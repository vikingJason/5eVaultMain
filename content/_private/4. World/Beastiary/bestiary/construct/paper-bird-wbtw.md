Endelyn writes her correspondence on sheets of enchanted parchment, which she then folds into the shape of paper birds that fly to their intended recipients. If a message's recipient is on another plane of existence or is otherwise unreachable, the paper bird bursts into flames on takeoff and is instantly destroyed.

The paper birds are hostile toward all creatures except the hags of the Hourglass Coven.
