In days gone by, Agdon Longscarf made a name for himself as he and his band of miscreants menaced travelers throughout various Feywild domains. It was in Prismeer, however, that Agdon's antics came to an end by Zybilna's hand. As punishment for his offenses, the archfey demanded that Agdon give up his beloved scarf. When he refused, Zybilna cursed him so that he would never be able to remove it. She then pinned the scarf to a young sapling with a magic nail made of gold and iron, and she bade the tree grow until its branches raked the clouds. Agdon was thus carried into the sky, where he was stranded for a long time.

The arrival of the Hourglass Coven signaled a reversal of Agdon Longscarf's fortunes. With Zybilna trapped in temporal stasis, Agdon's loyal gang was able to chop down his tree prison. But his scarf remained pinned to the felled trunk, and him with it, until Bavlorna struck a deal with him—she agreed to remove the nail and free the scarf in exchange for the best prize from each of his raids thereafter.

Agdon's scarf is a bright blue length of cloth that he claims was woven from lightning bolts he stole right out from under a dark cloud. The scarf can't be removed, even if Agdon dies. His branding iron functions for him alone, and it ceases to be hot when it leaves his hand. The brand it makes is shaped like three bounding rabbits connected nose to tail, forming a triangle.
