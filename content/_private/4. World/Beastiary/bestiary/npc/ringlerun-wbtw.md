# [Ringlerun](CLI/bestiary/npc/ringlerun-wbtw.md)
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 227*  

Ringlerun became an adventurer to better satisfy his craving for arcane knowledge. One of his adventures took him into an underwater tomb, where he tricked a marid into surrendering a staff of power. This staff greatly increased Ringlerun's capabilities and made him the envy of many rival spellcasters.

Ringlerun has a good heart, but he's easily distracted by intellectual pursuits. He would rather spend time in quiet contemplation or reading than in frivolous conversation.
