*The Tome of Strahd is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Stains and age have taken their toll, but several paragraphs at the beginning are plainly readable. The rest of the book is filled with a mixture of ciphers, fictional stories, and notes written in a curious shorthand that only Strahd employs.*

# Decoded Entry

*I am the Ancient. I am the Land. My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears stone into sand.*

*All goodness slipped from my life. I found my youth and strength gone, and all I had left was death. My army settled in the valley of Barovia and took power over the people in the name of a just god, but with none of a god's grace or justice.*

*I called for my family, long unseated from their ancient thrones, and brought them here to settle in the castle Ravenloft. They came with a younger brother of mine, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful. I hated him for both.*

*From the families of the valley, one spirit shone above all others. A rare beauty, who was called "perfection," "joy," and "treasure." Her name was Tatyana, and I longed for her to be mine.*

*I loved her with all my heart. I loved her for her youth. I loved her for her joy. But she spurned me! "Old One" was my name to her‚Äî"elder" and "brother" also. Her heart went to Sergei. They were betrothed. The date was set.*

*With words she called me "brother," but when I looked into her eyes they reflected another name: "death." It was the death of the aged that she saw in me. She loved her youth and enjoyed it. But I had squandered mine. The death she saw in me turned her from me. And so I came to hate death‚Äîmy death. My hate is very strong. I would not be called "death" so soon. I made a pact with death, a pact of blood. On the day of the wedding, I killed Sergei, my brother. My pact was sealed with his blood.*

*I found Tatyana weeping in the garden east of the chapel. She fled from me. She would not let me explain, and a great anger swelled within me. She had to understand the pact I made for her. I pursued her. Finally, in despair, she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft, and I watched everything I ever wanted fall from my grasp forever.*

*It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found. Not even I know her final fate. Arrows from the castle guards pierced me to my soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. I became undead, forever.*

*I have studied much since then. "Vampyr" is my new name. I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the living that took them from me. Even the sun is against me. It is the sun and its light I fear the most, but little else can harm me now. Even a stake through my heart does not kill me, though it holds me from movement. But the sword, that cursed sword that Sergei brought! I must dispose of that awful tool! I fear and hate it as much as the sun.*

*I have often hunted for Tatyana. I have even felt her within my grasp, but she escapes. She taunts me! She taunts me! What will it take to bend her love to me? I now reside far below Ravenloft. I live among the dead and sleep beneath the very stones of this hollow castle of despair. I shall seal shut the walls of the stairs that none may disturb me.*

## DC 10 - I am the land

**Twelfth Moon, 347 BC:** *I, Strahd, firstborn son of King Barov von Zarovich and Queen Ravenia Van Roeyen have finally achieved victory over the Tergs and the Order of the Silver Dragon. The Terg barbarians are routed, the Order‚Äôs dragon is dead. I have taken this valley for my own, in the name of my family and her lands. In my father‚Äôs honour, I name this place Barovia.*

*In the ancient rite of my people, I have spilled my own blood into the soil of Barovia. I am Strahd. I am the land. Draw near and witness.*

## DC 10 - Castle Ravenloft

**Twelfth Moon, 347 BC:** *I have taken the warlord's castle as my own. The fortifications are truly impressive and its cliffside position makes it nigh impregnable. A fitting place for a ruler; I have named it Castle Ravenloft, for my mother Ravenovia.*

*It is not without its faults, however. While the strange, labyrinthine architecture inside will certainly stymie any invaders, my own staff fare just as poorly. I have still yet to have receive a meal from the kitchen before it goes cold.*

*I suspect this place was designed by some mad old wizard.*

## DC 10 - Sergei

**Fourth Moon, 350 BC:** *Prince Sergei‚Äôs party arrived at Castle Ravenloft. It is an odd thing, to meet one‚Äôs baby brother for the first time and see him a grown man. My duty and passion for war swept me from the home of my childhood at a young age, never to return.*

*I had not seen my younger brother Sturm grow up, nor been there for Sergei's birth or for any of a thousand other joys that a man might take from the heart of his family. I had not even been able to attend the burial of our parents, four years past. In some part of my mind, they were still alive as I'd last seen them three decades ago; Sergei's presence has driven home the fact that this is not true.*

*The boy reminds me of myself in so many ways. Handsome, to be sure, and a devastating fighter. Yet he shows everything that I am not: affable, smiling and young. All the things that decades of war wear away from a man. He is truly lucky that his only duty is to the priesthood.*

## DC 10 - Tatyana

**Seventh Moon, 350 BC:** *Tatyana! Gods how wrong I was to dismiss the object of Sergei‚Äôs infatuation as some peasant whore! The woman is radiant. Graceful. A princess born to rags. The moment my eyes landed upon her, I felt things stir in my very soul that I had thought long since dead and buried.*

*And yet she has eyes only for Sergei. ‚ÄúElder‚Äù, she calls me, despite my invitations that she may address me as ‚ÄúStrahd‚Äù; a mark of respect in Barovia, I know, but I cannot help but feel it as an ice cold dagger to my heart.*

*He should have been a priest.*

## DC 20 - The Heart‚Äôs Desire

**Sixth Moon, 351 BC:** *My chamberlain has brought me an item of extraordinary interest , from one ‚ÄúPatrina Verikovna‚Äù, a woman of his tribe. I have given standing orders that any books of magical nature in my land are to be purchased and brought to me immediately, for proper preservation and use in my personal training in the arcane art. Most are near useless at best, of course, but this‚Ä¶ this is a tome of true power.*

*Among its multitude spells I have found mention of a ritual: a ritual to attain the ‚ÄúHeart‚Äôs Desire‚Äù. This is how I will do it! My heart‚Äôs desire. She will be mine at last!*

*The ritual speaks of an ancient temple, here, in Barovia; ‚ÄúThe Amber Temple‚Äù, hidden high in the Balinok Mountains. I must set out for it at once - there is no time to waste.*

## DC 15 - The Wedding

**Sixth Moon, 351 BC:** *The wedding of Sergei von Zarovich and Tatyana Federovna. I had thought my ritual an utter failure until I went to see my brother on the morn of his wedding to my own beloved. That is when I heard it. Death. It whispered in my ear, told me what I must do; the final step to forge the pact.*

*I took the Ba‚Äôal Verzi dagger from my treasury. A wedding present for Sergei. Before he was even aware of what was happening, the blade had already slipped between his ribs, into his beating heart. The final step: I fell upon my brother‚Äôs bleeding body and I drank.*

*I felt a vigor that I had not experienced in decades. It was as if with every step I shed another year, back to my prime once more! I informed the guards that a Ba‚Äôal Verzi assassin had murdered my own brother and must still be in the castle and I went to find my beloved Tatyana. Nothing stood between us now.*

*I found her at the chapel, told her of Sergei‚Äôs demise, held her as she wept. She looked up at me with those great, beautiful eyes, and finally I kissed her. It was everything I had dreamed of since I first laid eyes on her. But, confused by grief, she shook away from me. A heavy mist had rolled up to the castle walls. She ran, tripped, and fell from the walls of Ravenloft! I watched, powerless, as the only thing I ever wanted fall from my grasp forever.*

*It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found.*

*Staring into the white abyss before me, I became dully aware of the sound of screams and Leo Dilisnya‚Äôs treacherous laughter coming from inside the castle. An arrow thudded into my shoulder. Another. Another. Arrow after arrow pierced me to my very soul, but I did not die. Nor did I live. On that night I became undead, forever.*

## DC 15 - Arch-Traitor

**Third Moon, 398 BC:** *I finally found him. The arch-traitor; Leo Dilisnya. It was just as Lovina Wachter told me: the coward had been hiding in the abbey for gods-knows how long now. He fled like a whipped dog after his attempted coup on the night of my transformation, after he butchered my court and tried to take my land from me.*

*Clever as he is, he is still a fool. To think he actually believed he could slay me! Even at my weakest; in a holy place, in his den of magic wards and holy symbols of a dozen faiths, I was able to overpower him and I struck him down.*

*Death is too good for him.*

*I have turned him. My gift to the Wachter family for their loyalty is the eternal punishment of the architect of our shared pain! Lovina watched Dilisnya slaughter her family, so many years past, and now she can finally watch him suffer. He has been entombed beneath the Wachterhaus, immortal and ravenous. He will wither and starve. He will beg for death. A death that will never come.*

*It is still less than he deserves.*

# The Curse

## DC 15 - Reincarnation

**Second Moon, 391 BC:** *I know I am not mad. I am seeing familiar faces reborn. Perhaps something about these mists is trapping the souls which would pass beyond ‚Äî forcing some sort of reincarnation among my people. Do the Dark Powers mean to taunt me? Trap an entire people in an endless cycle of misery alongside my own? Perhaps they torment me with false hope ‚Äî that my Tatyana will be reborn too.*

## DC 15 - Reunion

**Sixth Moon, 445 BC:** *The Dark Powers of this land have cursed me. Every time I am within reach of my Tatyana, she is met with tragedy. A fall. A stake. A fever. Of all the myriad dangers this land presents, my love was taken by a mere fever! I must keep her safe next time ‚Äî no matter what it takes. Perhaps I may yet unravel the black threads of fate.*

## DC 25 - Replacement

**Eleventh Moon, 688 BC:** *Perhaps I have been wrong. Perhaps it is not reunion with Tatyana that will be my escape. Perhaps I need an heir? A replacement? Can I find or fashion another dark lord to govern this realm in my place?*

*Still, I must take care not to show weakness. I must take care not to show reluctance. No one must know how hollow I feel; how empty my omnipotence is in absence of satisfaction. My immortal, eternal image as the ruler of this dominion must never come into question. I must observe from afar.*

## DC 12 - Cat and Mouse

**Second Moon, 720 BC:** *There is but one thing other than my Tatyana that keeps me sane in the endless mundanity of my curse: these rarest of nights when the Mists deliver me not just some common bandit or whimpering farmhand, but a challenge!*

*I have long instructed the Vistani seers to guide the adventuring fools that are brought to my land on ‚Äúquests‚Äù that they believe will destroy me. The game of cat and mouse is oh so much more amusing when the mouse believes it is a fair fight.*

*This ‚ÄúDeath Knight‚Äù promises to be an intriguing guest indeed. Perhaps I will invite to my castle, that we may spar with words, before we spar with swords or sorcery.*

# Barovia

## DC 20 - The Roc

**Third Moon, 373 BC:** *The great roc of Mount Ghakis remains caged in the mists with us. I pacified it during my great campaign, but I fear it may prey upon my people if the lakes grow barren. That privilege is reserved only for me and my brides.*

## DC 12 - Genocide

**Second Moon, 382 BC:** *The crime of the elves is beyond all measure of forgiveness and justice. I should have eliminated them when I first conquered this valley. I have ordered the death of every female elf in the valley for what they have done to Patrina. The elves will never again sire children, nor know womanly comfort among their own kind. Despite their longevity, they will fade from existence as I outlive them.*

## DC 15 - Marina

**Ninth Moon, 400 BC:** *I was so close. She craved me. Pleaded for me to stay. I had nothing left to give but my own life‚Äôs blood and it was hers to take. She would at last be my bride. Just one more night for her sweet body to allow the change to take.*

*Yet I returned to see Tatyana's blood staining the earth and a stake through her beautiful heart by the hands of the two-faced, lecherous dog that adopted her. I hold all of Berez responsible and they will see no mercy. I am the land, and I will forever curse their precious river for their treason.*

*I shall erect a monument to her loss in her flower garden west of the mansion. A singular beauty in a wretched place.*

## DC 12 - The Vistani

**Twelfth Moon, 470 BC:** *The Vistani and I have reached a place of mutual benefit. They will serve as my eyes and in return I will grant them a lien from taxation and hunting. Perhaps now I may find my Tatyana before she finds disaster.*

*Alas, I am no closer to understanding their capability to traverse the impenetrable mist with such apparent ease and they are not wont to share their secrets.*

## DC 15 - The Morninglord

**Fourth Moon, 485 BC:** *An amusing twist. It seems that outlander boy spared by my guest was driven mad by his encounter and mistook the vampiric elf for some god of their shared homeland called ‚ÄúLathander Morning Lord‚Äù. He styles himself as a priest and preaches for his ‚ÄúMorninglord‚Äù in the village out of the abandoned church.*

*This cult will wither as quickly as the people abandoned their faith in Andral. The gods have no power here.*

## DC 20 - Baba Lysaga

**Seventh Moon, 563 BC:** *My old nursemaid, Baba Lysaga, now dwells in the marsh-ruins of Berez. She remains demented, obsessed, and dangerous. She too has communed with the Dark. I must keep her at a distance.*

## DC 15 - The Gulthias Tree

**Fifth Moon, 582 BC:** *The druids of Yester Hill have perverted their faith in the Land and rightfully worship me. The Ancient and the Land.*

*They have performed some kind of rite or ritual upon the stake I used to destroy General Vychen in my war against Azalin and have planted it at the crest of the hill. Through some bizarre act of druidcraft, they have caused it to sprout into a dark and bloody sapling.*

*Intriguing.*

## DC 20 - Order of the Silver Dragon

**Ghost Moon, 594:** *Horngaard's accursed silver knights have slain another adventuring fool. Almost a pity; they were a welcome distraction. From what I witnessed in my scrying orb, the knights slew them because they questing for my destruction. I do not understand why my once-mortal enemies would seek to defend me.*

## DC 20 - Exethanter

**Seventh Moon, 634 BC:** *Exethanter's feeble mind is eroding ever further. On my most recent visit I found him delirious and distracted. He seems unable to remember much, not even his magic. I do not envy the lich, nor do I pity him. It would seem that I chose all the more wisely in the means of immortality.*

## DC 30 - Amber Temple

**Eighth Moon, 634 BC:** *I cannot be sure, but I believe his life soul to be stored near his chambers. I could pry and find it, but I fear that would lead to hostilities, which aren't worth my time as it stands. Little remains of his memory. I must record the passwords of the Amber Temple so that they do not pass into the mists of eternity.*

*Dhaviton.*

*Thangob.*

*Shalx.*

*Etherna.*

# Castle Ravenloft

## DC 20 - The Heart of Ravenloft

**Tenth Moon, 526 BC:** *The Heart glows with purpose. It has become living. The circles of masonry about its tower are its ribs, the great bastion its chest. My tests on the condemned proved the heart will use the tower itself against invaders. My will sustains it, but its construction is mere glass, fragile, ironically mortal. With it, I am sheltered from the unthinkable, yet I will not allow myself to become reckless.*

## DC 25 - Armour

**Fifth Moon, 546 BC:** *I have succeeded in granting my old battle armor the same form of sentience Azalin bestowed upon his own. I have empowered it with my will and the might of storms and instructed it to defend the castle. In great need I may summon it to myself and don it with a single word.*

# Lands of the Mists

## DC 15 - Forlorn

**Third Moon, 547 BC:** *Barovia is not alone. I do not understand why or how, but for the first time in two centuries Barovia is not alone. The mist has retreated! The new land conforms perfectly to her southern border, yet it is not at all the landscape I remember. I feel this new land‚Äôs name resonating in my mind when I scry upon it: Forlorn.*

*I am no less a prisoner than I have been since these foul mists first descended. Whatever dark powers hold us here, they prevent me even from crossing into this Forlorn, although it seems the same is not true of my subjects and so I must assume, nor is it for the peoples (or creatures) of this Forlorn. I must be wary.*

## DC 15 - Mordent

**Eleventh Moon, 579 BC:** *Azalin‚Äôs blasted portal nearly destroyed us both! It is a wonder that preposterous tower even still stands. It seems that instead of pulling ourselves to the Material Plane, we instead pulled a portion of the Material Plane to us. Mordent. A gap remains in my memory and the exact events that unfolded around us there are unclear even to me, but the result is clear enough: Barovia has a new neighbour.*

*It as I knew all along: my only hope is Tatyana.*

## DC 15 - Darkon

**Twelfth Moon, 579 BC:** *It was too much to hope for that damned lich‚Äôs destruction along with his useless portal. The Dark Powers would never allow his escape, even in death. He is as much a deserving prisoner of the mists as I, and now he has his own cell: Darkon. Azalin Rex indeed. Pompous buffoon.*

*I shall have to levy my armies once more. It has been too long.*

## DC 20 - Sithicus

**Third Moon, 720 BC:** *The Death Knight has been ensnared in domain of his own: Sithicus. My spies tell me that his is a decrepit and mournful land of black roses, dark forests and crumbling cities; home to wild elves and other wicked fey creatures under a blood red moon. Lord Soth will not be pleased that I fooled him into thinking that he could ever return home to Krynn - I am sure that even now he plots his revenge from the heights of his Nedregaard Keep.*

# Enemies

*N.B. I decided that these are too irrelevant to the actual campaign and didn‚Äôt use them*

## DC 20 - Jander Sunstar

**Sixth Moon, 475 BC:** *The mists have deposited an intriguing new guest into my land; he calls himself ‚ÄúJander Sunstar‚Äù. He is an elf, not entirely unlike those fae folk, the Dusk Elves, that dwell in this very valley, but more interestingly‚Ä¶ he is a vampire. There may be much I can learn from him.*

*Jander tells me he found himself here after becoming lost flying through a heavy fog that came across a place called ‚ÄúWaterdeep‚Äù in his world of ‚ÄúToril‚Äù.*

*I brought my guest on a hunt, targeting some fresh outlanders foolishly camping in the open and the bleeding heart fool demanded their child be left unharmed! In the interest of planting myself in his trust, I bade my wives go hungry and allow the boy to live.*

## DC 20 - Azalin

**Twelfth Moon, 542 BC:** *The mists continue to draw lost souls to my land. This one seems different however: he is no petty bandit or thief; he is clearly an extremely accomplished wizard. I don‚Äôt trust him in the slightest, but he may be of use to me. The man hides much, but he goes by the name ‚ÄúAzalin‚Äù. He says he is of a world called ‚ÄúOerth‚Äù.*

*Azalin believes he can, with sufficient resources, build a portal that will transport us away from this place, to what he calls the ‚ÄúMaterial Plane‚Äù. If he is right, I might finally be free of this prison. He is teaching me much in the ways of magic in order to assist him. We are constructing a tower on the shore of Lake Zarovich to conduct his experiments.*

## DC 20 - Lyssa von Zarovich

**Ghost Moon, 707 BC:** *I have been informed that my scheming grand-niece has settled in the city of Zeidenburg in Gundarak, practically on Barovia‚Äôs doorstep. She must be up to something. The upstart whelp believes she can challenge my rule of Barovia just because she fancies herself a vampiress! Still, I must increase the presence of my spies in the city immediately. I must know who she attempts to court as allies against me.*

## DC 20 - Dr. Mordenheim

**Tenth Moon, 723 BC:** *Another outlander makes ripples in my land. A woman of science took up residence in the old Abbey of Saint Markovia some years back, as their so-called ‚Äúhospital‚Äù.*

*Now this depraved doctor takes me for a fool; she seeks to free Barovia of my sins through mere lust of the flesh. This perverted folly is at least an entertaining distraction. I have no interest in her depraved gift, of course; it is wholly unnatural to desire such an abomination. Tatyana will free me. When she returns, she will have me.*
