# Hidden Backgrounds

It's also worth incorporating some surprise revelations into the campaign if you can. These are plot points that the players wouldn't be necessarily looking for, but love to discover nonetheless.

Some examples:

Replacing Ireena with a PC. The PC discovers that they are being pursued by an evil vampire lord for some reason. As the campaign progresses, they find out they are the reincarnation of the lord's lost love, Tatyana. --- [[Aeli]]

Making a PC Izek's sibling. The PC discovers that they aren't the orphan they thought they were. They were actually born in Barovia and have a weird brother with a demon arm! --- [[Sorrow]]

A PC has Vistani roots. The PC discovers that their missing parent(s) were actually Vistani. Somehow, the PC was left behind and raised outside Barovia. Now they have a whole extended family they didn't know about.

The PC is from an order of knights. They discover that the silver knights of Argynvostholt were actually the precursors to their own order. --- [[Marcus]] 


# PC/Dark Power Interaction

* The relationship between a PC and a Dark Power is meant to feel like that between a PC and an important NPC. It's a subtle, private matter that should develop and grow as the campaign progresses. For specifics on developing this relationship, I've written up a full guide covering the stages of Dark Power interaction. You can find that post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/9zswmf/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_running_the_dark/).

	* In summary, the Dark Power is a god that answers the player's prayers, helping them should they ask. As the relationship develops, the Dark Power's traits and influences begin to show themselves through the PC. The PC's soul slowly comes to belong to the Dark Power.
	- Once the PC has developed a dependency on the Dark Power's guidance and gifts, the Dark Power starts to cause bad things to happen through the PC. However, because the PC is addicted to their relationship, they don't stop these things from happening. This is the direct, slow burning progression of a PC's moral decline throughout the campaign.
	
- I developed this method of running the Dark Powers to completely replace the vestiges in the Amber Temple and their evil gifts. Instead of random agreements causing PCs to suddenly turn evil, the decline happens over the course of the campaign and therefore has time to develop and feel natural.



## Individualized Powers

- Before the campaign began, I went through and customized a Dark Power for each of my players. If you're going to have an evil god slowly corrupt a player, you can't have him walk up and be like, "Hey! Kill all the civilians and I'll give you all the powweeerrrr!!!!" It has to be much more subtle to have any success.

- Each player and their character are going to have a personality they lean towards, a personality type with which they are more likely to make friends. Create a Dark Power that fits that personality mold. Essentially, you are customizing your PCs' best friends.


### Examples of Dark Powers

- The best thing I think I can give you are the examples from my own campaign. These are the three Dark Powers I developed for my three players.

#### The Evening Glory

- The Evening Glory is a Dark Power featured in the Adventure League modules. However, I reworked and developed her for the main campaign for the fighter in my party. The fighter is a knightly sort of guy, full of honor and fighting for the common good.

- I knew that power and other such temptations wouldn't work on the fighter. So instead, I developed the Evening Glory to be much more deceptive in her corruption. She appears as an angelic woman with long, radiant hair and wears a white dress. She’s deceptively beautiful and convinces others that she’s good. Glory is meant to play the innocent, not the seductress. She doesn’t flirt with the players or anything, but rather convinces them to fight for her in the same way a princess might dote on a gallant knight.

- The Evening Glory is inspired by true love. She believes in the bonds between individuals more than anything else. However, this belief is completely tainted, for Glory also thinks that anything left alive too long will inevitably erode and tarnish… even love. Because of this, she believes that the greatest mercy to be given is death. Anything bright and wonderful and good must be killed before it can be corrupted. And that’s what makes her evil.

- The Evening Glory’s powers are meant to be as deceptive as her appearance. She specializes in light/radiant attacks and magic. Her abilities also grant a lot of instant death. For instance, if your player has a bond with Glory and tries to go for a non-lethal kill, it will automatically kill the target anyway. Glory also has a lot of petrification abilities that can turn figures into marble or glass statues. After all, a statue cannot age or tarnish. Remember, she wants to preserve beautiful things.

#### Delban, Star of Ice and Hate

- This Power actually appears as one of the entities trapped at the Amber Temple. I developed him for my warlock player as her patron.

- Because the warlock already depended on her patron for her magic, I didn't have to make Delban particularly nice. In fact, I could take things in quite the opposite direction. I made Delban power hungry and cold. He would berate the warlock when she failed and remain silent when she succeeded. In Delban's mind, there is no room for weakness. In a way, he's a very abusive, militaristic sort of Dark Power.

- From his title, I made Delban's abilities have everything to do with cold. If/when the warlock gained levels and got closer with Delban, she gained boons and cosmetic traits which had to do with cold.

#### Turian, Whisperer of Words

- Turian is a completely original Dark Power I created for the rogue in my party. Turian is meant to reflect Loki from old Norse mythology. He's the ultimate trickster. I felt like my wise-cracking rogue would respond well to such a character.

- Turian is a god of chaos and lies. He pretends to make friends with mortals but in reality feels no connection to them, preferring to use them and turn brother against brother for his own entertainment. What he hates the most is the boring and mundane. Turian physically appears the most human in my lot of Dark Powers. If my players come in contact with him, I want them to like and trust him, after all. However, they won’t know that’s he’s actively playing to their whims and desires to turn them against one another.

- Any power having to do with Turian is going to be fast paced, allowing his champion to zip around and sneak like a boss. They’ll also have levels of enchantment and illusion magic, allowing them to trick and manipulate multiple enemies at once.



# PC Death in Barovia

I am personally not a huge fan of permanent player character death in a dnd campaign. While I know that sometimes the dice are simply not in our favor, PC death can hit us like an anvil. Both myself and my players tend to invest a lot of emotional and mental energy into their characters, so loosing them unexpectedly breaks our hearts. And let's face it, CoS RAW has some pretty unfair, TPK inducing encounters throughout the book.

To that effect, I've outlined a few ways to deal with PC death in the CoS Campaign, to give your players every chance to keep their characters before having to roll a new sheet.

### Resurrection

- Firstly, remember that resurrection is possible in Barovia by means of the Abbott in Kresk. Prior to the party getting to this location, you should have native Barovians drop hints that the Abbott is a powerful man of the Morninglord and is known for creating miracles. Specifically, there's a rumor that he brought back a young boy from the grave.

- Much more secretly, both Jeny Greenteeth and Madam Eva can resurrect the dead. However, neither will do so lightly.


### Dark Power Intervention

- During their time in Barovia, your players should start attracting the attention of Dark Powers, as previously stated.

- If there comes a time when one of your players is in a pretty dire situation and happens to die, you can have the Dark Power come to their aid. After all, an evil god probably doesn’t want to loose its chosen plaything. Players can temporarily enter a Beast Mode version of themselves as they’re overwhelmed with the ability of the Dark Power. They can then use their temporary power to crush their enemies before becoming drained again.

- Having the Dark Powers intervene can be a story relevant way to avoid character death in CoS. But it should come with a price.

### Strahd Intervenes

- This could be pretty darn interesting, but also depends heavily on Strahd’s opinion of the party at any given time during the campaign. If Strahd actively hates a character, he won’t care if that character dies. However, if Strahd finds the characters interesting playthings in his lands, he might not want to see them die just yet.

- If death seems imminent for a character, you might just have the dark lord himself arrive on scene. I would play it like Strahd is there to finish off the party on his own. Strahd should toy with your players’ terror, making them feel cornered. And then, at the last possible moment, Strahd turns around and slays the enemy instead. This will show your players just how fickle Strahd is and how very little he cares about the lives of others. And at the same time, you’ve craftily avoided a character death.

- This is actually a really good option for early game PC death.
