Each player has a dream, something from their past, present and future, all hinting towards the importance of working together ... perhaps a shared history???

Esmerelda meets them at Rictavio's tower.
- find silvered weapons
- the treasure
- offers to show Aeli a few things with a weapon
- Rictavios journal
	- notes on Strahd, Vistani, Keepers, Fanes

They are confronted by Werewolves, Esmerelda is killed helping them escape.
Ireena is attacked, Strahd kills the Werewolf OR is cursed with Lycanthropy and only a Cleric can help her.

Need some likeable NPCs in Vallaki
Wolf Hunters - can find some near the Tower
- Keepers - 
- Blinksy - 
- Rictavio -
- A secret herablist / town Wisdom - has had to hide what they can do for fear of being labelled a friend of Strahd.
	- Can provide a special brew to relieve exhaustion (coffee - but can cause addiction)
	- Reveals the best herbs are in the boggy marsh to the south, but it is too dangerous to go herself.
- Vistani from the camp???

- Izek appeals to Sorrow who is also an orphan, a shared life journey etc

Need to reveal the book club is a cult somehow
- spot some people wearing black cloaks heading to Lady Wachter's mansion
- priest will reveal rumors od the cult, but doesn't believe it - he is a just person.

Need to get rid of the possessions
- Rictavio offers to help them with a special ritual, bit will need his journal
- Baron's son can tra sport them to another dimension using his portal - possible side effects
