Given that Aeli is already a fighter and her motivation for seeking greater strength stems from wanting to best her brother, we can refine the structure to focus on improving her fighting abilities and strength through her bond with the revenant. This bond will give her enhanced martial prowess but at a cost, which mirrors the revenant’s tragic nature. The revenant, a former member of the **Order of the Silver Dragon**, offers to guide Aeli down a path of intense combat mastery, helping her achieve the power she seeks but at the risk of her humanity.

### **Revenant's Martial Teachings: Benefits & Flaws**

|**Level**|**Benefit**|**Flaw**|
|---|---|---|
|**1**|The revenant teaches her precision. Aeli gains **Expertise** in one weapon she’s proficient with (doubles her proficiency bonus for attack rolls with that weapon).|Aeli becomes haunted by the revenant’s memories of defeat. She suffers disadvantage on **Wisdom saving throws** against fear effects when fighting undead.|
|**2**|The revenant trains her to anticipate attacks. Aeli gains proficiency in **Dexterity saving throws**.|She becomes more focused on combat, but at the cost of her empathy. Aeli has disadvantage on **Insight** checks to detect lies or gauge emotions.|
|**3**|Aeli learns relentless offense. She can now use **Action Surge** (gains one extra action) an additional time per long rest.|Her drive to win isolates her emotionally. Aeli gains disadvantage on **Charisma** checks in social settings where she needs to connect emotionally (persuasion, performance).|
|**4**|Her strength increases dramatically. Aeli’s **Strength** score increases by 2 (up to a maximum of 20), and she gains advantage on **Strength checks** to break objects or grapple enemies.|Her body begins to show the toll of her focus. She now suffers disadvantage on **Constitution saving throws** related to resisting disease and poison.|
|**5**|Aeli can channel the revenant’s power for **ghostly agility**: once per long rest, she can take the **Dodge** action as a bonus action for 1 minute, giving enemies disadvantage on attacks against her.|After using this ability, Aeli feels the drain of death. She gains one level of **exhaustion** (which must be removed by a long rest).|
|**6**|Aeli’s senses sharpen. She gains **Blindsight** out to 15 feet, allowing her to sense creatures and objects around her without sight.|The revenant’s influence starts to cloud her humanity. Aeli gains disadvantage on **death saving throws** when unconscious.|
|**7**|Her reflexes are honed to perfection. She gains **Uncanny Dodge**, allowing her to use her reaction to halve the damage of an attack she can see.|Her ability to dodge grows at the expense of her stamina. Aeli’s hit point maximum is reduced by 5 permanently.|
|**8**|Aeli’s connection to the Order allows her to deal **radiant damage** on weapon attacks once per short rest. She adds 1d6 radiant damage to every attack for 1 minute.|This divine power weighs on her mortal frame. After using this ability, Aeli cannot heal through any means (magical or rest) for 24 hours.|
|**9**|She gains an advanced technique called **Steel Resolve**: once per long rest, if Aeli’s hit points are reduced to 0, she can instead choose to drop to 1 hit point.|Her mortal body can no longer keep up. She now ages twice as fast due to the strain of training, and her maximum hit points are reduced by 5 more.|
|**10**|Aeli becomes the revenant’s chosen disciple. She can use **Indomitable** (re-roll a failed saving throw) two additional times per long rest.|Aeli's soul is tied to the revenant’s fate. If she dies before defeating Strahd, she will rise as a revenant bound to the Order’s tragic curse.|

### **Ways to Break or Fully Embrace the Revenant’s Influence**

#### **Breaking the Bond**

|**Method**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Seek out an ancient warrior** of the Order of the Silver Dragon|Finding a surviving member or spirit who can help sever the bond could remove the revenant’s influence, but at the cost of Aeli losing all benefits gained.|
|**Reconcile with her brother**, proving her worth without the revenant’s help|This could break the revenant’s hold, though Aeli would no longer have access to his guidance or power.|
|**Destroy the revenant**|This would end the bond, but Aeli would be haunted by his death, suffering **disadvantage on saving throws** related to undead for a time.|

#### **Embracing the Bond**

|**Method**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Achieve victory against Strahd** using the revenant’s training|This path leads Aeli to full mastery of the martial arts, gaining her full benefits and potentially becoming a legendary warrior of Barovia.|
|**Challenge her brother and defeat him**|Aeli’s victory over her brother would cement her prowess, and the revenant would see her as the ideal disciple. She gains +1 Strength permanently.|

### **Narrative Considerations**

- **Rivalry**: Aeli’s rivalry with her brother drives her, but the revenant’s tragic, unyielding nature may lead her to darker, more obsessive behavior. This could cause friction with her party or inner conflict as she balances ambition with humanity.
- **Roleplay Opportunities**: The revenant offers Aeli the power she craves, but also threatens to consume her soul in the process. Her interactions with her brother and party could be deeply impacted by how much she is willing to sacrifice for strength.
- **Moral Dilemma**: Does Aeli fully embrace the revenant’s path, becoming a weapon of vengeance, or does she reconcile with her brother and find a way to become strong on her own?

This structure offers Aeli a clear path toward martial mastery but keeps the narrative grounded in the core themes of ambition, sacrifice, and identity.





For Aeli, who seeks to improve her fighting ability, the encounter with a revenant from the Order of the Silver Dragon offers a powerful yet tragic opportunity. The revenant offers training, strength, and guidance in exchange for her aid in ridding Barovia of Strahd and bringing peace to his lost love. Below is a structured system of **benefits** and **flaws** that grow as Aeli becomes more entangled with the revenant's cause, along with **actions that strengthen or weaken the bond**, **reactions from Strahd and his forces**, and **paths to break or fully embrace the revenant's influence**.
