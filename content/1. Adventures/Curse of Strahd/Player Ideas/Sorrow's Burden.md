For Sorrow, the possession by **Thorn Durst** amplifies her deepest fears of abandonment and loneliness. Thorn, a spirit of a fearful child, tries to take full control of her by feeding her anxieties and manipulating her into believing that her party, much like her family, will abandon her. The tension between Sorrow's desire for connection and Thorn's manipulative presence creates a powerful inner conflict.

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**     | Sorrow becomes hyper-aware of her surroundings due to Thorn’s constant fear, giving her **advantage on Perception checks** to detect threats.          | Thorn’s fear overwhelms Sorrow, causing her to suffer from **disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws** against fear effects.                                                                                                                                |
| **2**     | Thorn’s presence allows Sorrow to sense the undead, granting her the ability to cast **Detect Evil and Good** once per long rest.                      | Thorn begins to warp Sorrow’s mind, whispering doubts. She suffers **disadvantage on Insight checks** when interacting with her party, as Thorn convinces her they are planning to leave her.                                                            |
| **3**     | Thorn’s desperation to stay alive strengthens Sorrow’s resolve. She gains **+1 to Wisdom saving throws**.                                              | Sorrow begins to fear abandonment even more deeply. She must make a Wisdom saving throw whenever a party member moves more than 30 feet away from her in combat. On a failed save, Sorrow is **Frightened**.                                             |
| **4**     | Thorn’s protective nature gives Sorrow an unnatural ability to escape danger. She gains the ability to cast **Misty Step** once per long rest.         | Thorn’s manipulations increase. Sorrow has a 1-in-4 chance of hearing Thorn’s voice telling her that her party is leaving her after every long rest (DM’s discretion), causing her to suffer disadvantage on her first Wisdom saving throw of the day.   |
| **5**     | Sorrow becomes more resilient, gaining **+5 temporary hit points** when reduced to 0 HP, as Thorn fights to survive.                                   | Thorn’s presence becomes unbearable, and Sorrow must make a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** at the end of every long rest or gain the **Frightened condition** for the next hour.                                                                          |
| **6**     | Thorn’s bond with Sorrow becomes almost symbiotic. Sorrow gains the ability to cast **Shield** once per long rest as Thorn instinctively protects her. | Thorn’s fear of losing control leads to a final act of desperation. If Sorrow fails three consecutive Wisdom saving throws while possessed, Thorn fully **possesses** Sorrow, and the DM takes control of her actions until the possession is exorcised. |

### **Ways to Exorcise Thorn Durst’s Spirit**

#### **Exorcising Thorn**

|**Method**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Confront Thorn at the Durst Manor**|Returning to the place of Thorn’s death and confronting the child’s spirit directly may force Thorn to leave Sorrow’s body. Sorrow will need to confront Thorn’s original fear of dying alone.|
|**Use of Powerful Divine Magic**|A powerful cleric or paladin (or a party member capable of casting **Greater Restoration**, **Remove Curse**, or **Dispel Evil and Good**) can expel Thorn’s spirit from Sorrow’s body.|
|**Sacrifice for Thorn’s Peace**|Sorrow may need to offer something of great personal value to give Thorn peace, such as confronting her own feelings of abandonment or promising to care for Thorn’s spirit in some way (a personal vow, or laying his body to rest).|
|**Reuniting Thorn with His Family**|Bringing Thorn’s bones to rest beside his parents and helping the Durst family find peace could weaken Thorn’s hold and allow him to pass on.|
|**Therapy Through Confrontation**|Sorrow must face Thorn’s fears directly and convince him that he is safe and cared for. This would involve significant roleplaying where Sorrow reassures Thorn that he will not be abandoned, giving him peace and release.|

#### **Thorn’s Full Possession**

| **Method**                              | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Allowing Thorn to Take Full Control** | If Sorrow allows Thorn to fully possess her, she will need to battle the spirit in her mind, either alone or with the help of a **Mentalist** NPC. Failure could mean Thorn takes over her body permanently.                           |
| **Party’s Role in Exorcism**            | The party may need to intervene to protect Sorrow from herself as Thorn takes over, binding or restraining her until Thorn’s influence can be broken.                                                                                  |
| **Breaking Thorn’s Spirit**             | Confronting Thorn’s fears in a final battle of wills could lead to a direct mental confrontation with the child spirit. Sorrow must convince Thorn that he no longer needs to fear or be alone, or forcefully expel him from her mind. |
