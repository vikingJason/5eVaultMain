|---|---|
|**Sabotaging a town’s food supply**, ensuring chaos and death in the wake of famine|Gain an extra use of Vampiric Bite until the next long rest|
|**Sacrificing an innocent life** to further his own power|Gain a permanent increase in HP equal to the sacrificed creature's level or challenge rating|

|**Spreading terror** (e.g., revealing dark secrets or framing innocents) in Strahd’s domain|Vampyr grants temporary immunity to fear effects for 1d4 days|



### **Acts that Anger the Vampyr**

|**Act**|**Vampyr’s Reaction**|
|---|---|
|**Killing Strahd’s vampire spawn** or interfering with Strahd’s plans in Barovia|Immediate loss of a benefit and gain of a severe flaw (e.g., sun blindness)|
|**Aiding Van Richten** (knowingly or unknowingly) in any way|Marked for punishment by the Vampyr|
|**Healing or assisting a cleric** who worships a holy deity opposed to Strahd or Vampyr|Marcus begins losing HP (1d6 per day) until he atones|
|**Avoiding acts of evil** (such as refusing to harm innocents)|Vampyr grows impatient and inflicts a painful reminder|
|**Attempting to resist the vampiric transformation** by embracing humanity or forming strong bonds with good-aligned allies|Vampyr strips Marcus of benefits temporarily and sends enemies to kill his allies|



### **Punishments from the Vampyr (for Defying the Pact)**

|**Action**|**Punishment**|
|---|---|
|**Killing Strahd’s vampire spawn**|Sun blindness—Marcus has disadvantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks in sunlight until he atones.|
|**Aiding Van Richten**|Marcus loses regeneration for a week, making him vulnerable to attacks and damage, especially if critically wounded.|
|**Refusing to commit acts of terror or sabotage**|Marcus’ healing abilities are reduced by half, and he gains levels of exhaustion until he complies.|
|**Embracing good or altruistic behavior**|A painful brand appears on Marcus’ skin, and he takes 1d4 psychic damage for each good deed.|
|**Destroying a relic of evil**|Vampyr sends Strahd's minions after Marcus with the intent to severely wound or imprison him.|
|**Rejecting the vampiric transformation**|Marcus suffers excruciating nightmares, leading to a permanent level of exhaustion unless he submits.|



### **Ways to Remove the Curse/Break the Pact**

|**Method**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Seek out a powerful holy relic** of a deity such as the Morninglord, capable of severing dark pacts|The relic must be brought to a sacred place in Barovia and activated in a ritual with other powerful artifacts.|
|**Make a deal with Strahd** to intervene|Strahd may be willing to assist if Marcus can prove his worth or usefulness, but this may result in exchanging one master for another.|
|**Kill the Vampyr**|This nearly impossible feat would require locating the source of the Vampyr’s power and destroying it, potentially freeing Marcus from the pact but at great personal risk.|
|**Perform a ritual of absolution** at a shrine or holy site dedicated to Lathander or a similar deity|This ritual will require rare components and a significant sacrifice (such as a cherished ally or artifact) to succeed.|
|**Willingly submit to a cleric** or holy figure capable of casting a _Remove Curse_ spell or equivalent magic|The curse is powerful, so higher-level spells such as _Wish_ or a divine intervention might be necessary, and Marcus may need to perform a great act of penance to make it work.|
|**Assist Van Richten** unknowingly|Van Richten may have knowledge of how to sever pacts with dark powers but will only assist if Marcus can prove he is truly seeking redemption.|




### **Notes for Story Integration**

- **Character Development**: The evolving benefits and flaws create a moral struggle for Marcus, pulling him deeper into darkness while forcing him to weigh the consequences of his actions.
- **Conflict of Interest**: As Marcus unknowingly aids Strahd's disciple, Van Richten, the revelation that Van Richten is Strahd’s enemy can lead to dramatic tension and a pivotal moment where Marcus must choose sides.
- **Party Dynamics**: As Marcus becomes more corrupted by the Vampyr, his actions may put the party at risk, creating opportunities for roleplay and intrigue. His party members might notice his changing behavior and flaws.
