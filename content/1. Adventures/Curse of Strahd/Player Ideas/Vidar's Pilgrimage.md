Instead for Vidar, he meets a missionary (or is asked by Lady Wachter) in Vallaki who offers information about his father in exchange for helping him spread the word of the Nightmother in Barovia. The priest shares the story of how his father was the head of an noble family that disappeared after the Patriarch was caught stealing from Castle Ravenloft and imprisoned by Strahd. Rumour has it that he sacrificed his wealth and safety so Tymora would bless his wife and son, and keep them safe. 
The Durst family learned of this, and informed Strahd trying to gain his favour. Vidar is currently possessed by the ghost of Rose Durst. The spirit of Rose  will get angrier the more that Vidar learns.
Spreading the word of the Nightmother strengthens Vidar's cleric connection with her, and weakens it with Tymora.
The information will eventually reveal his father's whereabouts. 



Here’s a detailed structure for Vidar’s interactions with the **Priest of the Nightmother** and his growing conflict between his devotion to **Tymora** and the new influence of the **Nightmother** (also known as **Mother Night** in Barovia). Vidar’s journey will be shaped by the dual influence of the **priest** and the spirit of **Rose Durst**, who becomes increasingly angry as Vidar learns more about his past.

### **Blessings of the Nightmother: Benefits & Flaws**

Vidar’s connection to the **Nightmother** strengthens as he spreads her word, but this comes at the cost of his bond with **Tymora**. The benefits granted by the Nightmother grow in power, but each benefit comes with a corresponding flaw tied to his weakening connection to Tymora and his possession by Rose Durst.


| Level                                | Benefits (from Nightmother)                                                                                                                                           | Flaws (from Rose Durst)                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Level 1: Initiate                    | Gains minor blessings from the Nightmother. Vidar gains advantage on **Stealth** during the evening and can cast **Guidance** and **Thaumaturgy** at will.            | Rose’s presence begins to manifest, causing Vidar to suffer **disadvantage on Insight checks** to read the emotions or motives of others, as Rose clouds his judgment.                                                              |
| Level 2: Worshipper                  | Vidar's divine connection strengthens, gaining a +1 to **Cleric spell save DC** while in darkness or dim light.                                                       | Rose’s anger grows, causing unsettling visions during rest, imposing disadvantage on saving throws against fear.                                                                                                                    |
| Level 3: Devoted                     | Vidar gains access to **Invisibility** without having to prepare it and can cast it once per day without  using a spell slot.                                         | Vidar starts experiencing **nightmares** involving Rose and the Durst family, causing him to suffer **disadvantage on all Concentration checks** saving throws after a long rest unless he succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. |
| Level 4:  Disciple                   | Vidar can channel the Nightmother’s power to **turn undead** with more potency. Undead creatures turned by Vidar are paralyzed for 1 minute in addition to fleeing.   | Vidar’s connection to Tymora weakens further. He suffers **disadvantage on all saving throws**.                                                                                                                                     |
| Level 5: Acolyte of the Nightmother  | Gains **Undying Endurance**: once per long rest, Vidar can drop to 1 HP instead of 0.                                                                                 | Suffers from **Soul Decay**: any healing he receives is halved. <br> <br>Suffers **Weakened Light Magic**: damage and healing from radiant spells are halved.                                                                       |
| Level 6: Champion of the Nightmother | Vidar fully embraces the Nightmother’s blessing, to cast **Shadow of Moil** once per long rest, cloaking himself in shadows and dealing necrotic damage to attackers. | Vidar is on the verge of losing himself to Rose’s spirit and the Nightmother’s power. He must make a **DC 18 Wisdom saving throw** every day or fall completely under their control, becoming a puppet for the Nightmother.         |

---



### **Acts That Increase Benefits:**

Vidar’s connection to the Nightmother deepens as he spreads her influence and adheres to her dark will. The following acts enhance his benefits:

1. **Spreading Her Influence:**  
    Vidar preaches the Nightmother’s faith in Barovia’s villages, converting at least one person per week to her worship.
    
2. **Defiling Sacred Sites:**  
    Desecrating shrines or churches of Tymora or other deities strengthens his connection to the Nightmother. For example, painting the Nightmother’s symbol on the walls or performing dark rituals in sacred spaces.
    
3. **Performing Rituals of Night:**  
    Vidar performs sacrifices or rituals to the Nightmother during the full moon, bringing offerings such as blood or the essence of fear.
    
4. **Enacting Her Will:**  
    Completing specific missions for the Nightmother through the priest, such as assassinating individuals who oppose her faith, strengthens the bond and boosts his powers.
    
5. **Renouncing Tymora:**  
    Publicly rejecting Tymora’s teachings and declaring his allegiance to the Nightmother, especially before former allies, brings great favor.
    

---

### **Acts That Cause the Priest/Nightmother to Become Angry:**

Vidar’s pact with the priest and the Nightmother is fragile. If he disobeys or hesitates, they will withdraw their favor and eventually turn against him. These acts might provoke their anger:

1. **Showing Sympathy for Tymora:**  
    Any act of faith or reverence for Tymora, such as praying or helping a fellow worshiper, would cause the Nightmother’s anger to stir.
    
2. **Hesitation in Preaching Her Faith:**  
    Failing to actively spread the Nightmother’s word when given an opportunity weakens the bond. Hesitation or fear of repercussions also angers the priest.
    
3. **Helping Those Opposed to Her:**  
    Offering assistance to those who follow other deities, or aiding individuals who work against the Nightmother’s influence, would spark her ire.
    
4. **Breaking Sacred Oaths:**  
    If Vidar swears to perform a ritual or act in the Nightmother’s name but fails to follow through, the bond will weaken, and her anger will grow.
    
5. **Disobeying the Priest’s Direct Orders:**  
    The priest acts as the Nightmother’s emissary in Barovia. Failing to complete the tasks given by the priest or going against their instructions will damage the relationship.
    

---

### **Methods of Correction:**

When Vidar strays from the agreed path or angers the Nightmother, the priest and the Nightmother have various ways of "correcting" his behavior. These range from subtle manipulations to outright punishment.

1. **Withdrawal of Powers:**  
    The Nightmother can revoke the blessings and abilities she’s granted Vidar. If he fails to uphold his part of the bargain, he may lose access to his divine spells or abilities until he atones.
    
2. **Manipulation Through Dreams:**  
    The priest could send nightmarish visions to Vidar, causing fear and guilt. These dreams could show his father’s suffering in Strahd’s dungeons or glimpses of Rose Durst’s anger building inside him.
    
3. **Public Humiliation:**  
    The priest may force Vidar to perform penance publicly, humiliating him in front of Barovians. This could involve confessing failures or being ritually punished.
    
4. **Spiritual Punishment (Curses):**  
    The Nightmother might inflict a curse upon Vidar, such as imposing permanent disadvantage on saving throws against fear, restricting his access to certain spells, or giving him a curse that weakens him during daylight hours.
    
5. **Possession by Rose Durst:**  
    If Vidar disobeys too often, Rose Durst’s spirit might seize control of his body more frequently, preventing him from acting freely. The Nightmother, through Rose, could force Vidar to complete tasks against his will until he redeems himself.
    

---

### **Removing the Curse/Agreement:**

Breaking free of the pact with the Nightmother and the priest, and shaking off Rose Durst’s possession, will be extremely difficult. Vidar would need to undergo trials of faith and courage. Here are potential ways for him to remove the curse/agreement:

1. **Restoring Faith in Tymora:**  
    Vidar must perform a grand act of faith to regain Tymora’s favor. This could involve a pilgrimage to one of her ancient shrines or retrieving a lost relic of Tymora to prove his devotion.
    
2. **Cleansing the Spirit of Rose Durst:**  
    To rid himself of Rose Durst’s possession, Vidar must help her spirit find peace. This could mean confronting her past, perhaps finding justice for the Durst family or revealing a secret about their betrayal of his father. Once Rose is at peace, her spirit will leave.
    
3. **Confronting the Nightmother:**  
    Vidar could try to sever his ties to the Nightmother by confronting her through an intermediary, like the priest or even a dark ritual. This would involve a dangerous trial, where Vidar may have to sacrifice something dear to him (e.g., his changeling nature or a piece of his soul) to be freed.
    
4. **Exorcism:**  
    If Rose’s possession becomes too much, Vidar could seek out a powerful priest or paladin willing to perform an exorcism. This would require gathering rare components and possibly confronting Rose’s spirit directly during the ritual.
    
5. **Breaking the Priest’s Hold:**  
    Vidar may find clues that the priest is manipulating him, using the Nightmother’s influence for personal gain. By exposing the priest’s lies or undermining his position in Vallaki, Vidar could weaken the bond and free himself.
    

---

### **Integration into the Story:**

- **Gradual Revelation:**  
    The more Vidar spreads the Nightmother’s influence, the more the priest reveals about his father. At each level of commitment, Vidar learns new pieces of the puzzle — hints about his father’s final days and the Durst family’s betrayal.
    
- **Building Tension with Rose:**  
    Rose’s spirit reacts to every revelation, growing angrier as Vidar learns more about his family’s connection to Strahd and the Durst family’s betrayal. As Vidar nears the truth, Rose may try to sabotage him, making him doubt his actions or even lashing out in violent possession.
    
- **Climactic Confrontation:**  
    The bond with the Nightmother culminates in a choice: does Vidar fully commit to her, gaining the final piece of information about his father, or does he reject her in favor of Tymora? This decision could result in a major shift in power, with Vidar either gaining a powerful artifact or being cast out of her favor.

Here’s a continuation and further expansion on how Vidar’s progression with the **Nightmother** and his conflict between **Tymora** and the **priest** of Vallaki can develop over time. We will explore more nuanced ideas on how the growing tension impacts Vidar's gameplay, his interactions with NPCs, and the overall story arc.

---

### **Deeper Influence of the Nightmother: Possession and Struggles**

As Vidar’s connection to the **Nightmother** deepens and the spirit of **Rose Durst** strengthens within him, his internal struggle escalates. This conflict will have lasting effects on his physical, mental, and emotional state, causing challenges both in roleplay and mechanically in the campaign.

#### **Growing Signs of Possession by Rose Durst**

At certain milestones (based on the levels of benefits gained or key plot points), Rose Durst’s possession manifests more visibly:

|**Milestone**|**Manifestation**|
|---|---|
|**First Realization**|Vidar begins to see reflections of Rose’s face instead of his own in mirrors or water. The more time passes, the more frequent these reflections become.|
|**Loss of Control**|During moments of heightened stress (combat, arguments, intense roleplay), Rose’s spirit takes control of Vidar for brief periods. He may speak in her voice or take actions contrary to his will.|
|**Spiritual Warping**|Vidar’s physical appearance subtly shifts, gaining childlike features (resembling Rose’s age) such as wide eyes, soft voice, or innocent facial expressions.|
|**Memory Gaps**|Vidar experiences **memory blackouts**, waking up to find himself having acted in ways he cannot recall, such as performing rituals for the Nightmother or communicating with the dead.|
|**Possessive Strength**|Rose’s control over Vidar grows stronger in situations where he actively seeks information about his past or betrays the Nightmother, causing him to take drastic actions against his will (such as harming allies, seeking out dark rituals, or attacking followers of Tymora).|
|**Final Struggle**|At the highest point of conflict, Rose fully manifests through Vidar, possibly as a spiritual avatar (or physically through possession). This moment marks a turning point where Vidar must either find a way to free himself from her influence or risk permanent possession.|

#### **Rose Durst’s Influence on Roleplay and Storytelling**

Rose’s spirit is not simply a passive presence; she has her own motives, fears, and desires. She may:

- **Push Vidar to seek vengeance** against Strahd for what happened to her family.
- **Manipulate Vidar’s decisions** when interacting with other NPCs, especially those connected to Barovian nobility.
- **Show jealousy** when Vidar becomes close to allies, especially those who are parental or sibling figures.
- **Offer cryptic guidance**, using knowledge from her time as a Durst to help Vidar—though her advice will often be tainted by her emotions.
- **Appear as a visible spirit** to Vidar in times of crisis, whether as a helper or an antagonist.

---

### **Acts That Strengthen or Weaken the Curse**

Here is a refined list of how Vidar can further his connection to the **Nightmother** or weaken it, particularly through the possession of **Rose Durst**.

#### **Actions That Strengthen Vidar’s Connection to the Nightmother**

|**Action**|**Effect**|
|---|---|
|**Spreading the Word of the Nightmother**|Each time Vidar persuades a Barovian to offer their prayers to the Nightmother or abandon their previous faith, the Nightmother rewards him with increased power. Vidar immediately receives an upgrade to one of his benefits (gains a new ability or restores lost powers).|
|**Defiling Sacred Ground**|By desecrating a shrine or holy place dedicated to Tymora, the Morninglord, or any other opposing deity, Vidar earns the Nightmother’s favor. He regains all expended spell slots of level 3 or lower and gains temporary hit points.|
|**Ritual Offerings**|Vidar can perform dark rituals in honor of the Nightmother, which require sacrifices (be it creatures, rare items, or blood offerings). These rituals increase his divine spellcasting power, granting him advantage on all Wisdom-based spellcasting rolls for 1d4 days.|
|**Restoring Barovian Land to Darkness**|Aiding the spread of the Nightmother’s influence over Barovian land (such as driving out sunlight or restoring cursed areas) grants Vidar divine boons. He can cast **Hallow** (but in a twisted, dark version) without material components.|
|**Corrupting a Temple**|Vidar can weaken a temple or sacred space, turning its blessings into curses. By successfully completing this act, Vidar gains the ability to cast **Animate Dead** without material components.|

#### **Actions That Weaken Vidar’s Connection to the Nightmother**

|**Action**|**Effect**|
|---|---|
|**Performing Acts of Devotion to Tymora**|For every act Vidar performs in **Tymora’s name** (such as healing others, spreading her word, or performing luck-based miracles), his connection to the Nightmother weakens. He loses one benefit level for every significant act of devotion.|
|**Helping the Keepers of the Feather**|Vidar’s actions that aid the Keepers of the Feather or any resistance movement against Strahd cause the Nightmother’s influence to weaken. Vidar temporarily loses access to his benefits for 1d4 days and must perform a dark act to regain them.|
|**Seeking Knowledge About His Father**|Each time Vidar uncovers more about his past or speaks to those who knew his father, Rose’s possession intensifies. He suffers emotional torment and loses access to one of his divine spells (his choice) for the next 24 hours.|
|**Destroying Undead**|Vidar is expected to preserve and assist undead that serve the Nightmother. If he destroys them, he must make a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or be cursed with nightmares, preventing him from gaining the benefits of long rests.|
|**Refusing the Priest's Orders**|The priest in Vallaki serves as a direct agent of the Nightmother. Refusing his instructions or acting against his wishes will cause Vidar’s connection to the Nightmother to weaken, leading to disadvantage on all divine spellcasting rolls for 1d4 days.|

---

### **Priest's Methods to Correct Vidar’s Defiance**

If Vidar acts against the Nightmother or disobeys the priest in Vallaki, they will use several methods to "correct" his course:

1. **Dream Visions:** The Nightmother sends terrifying, vivid nightmares that show Vidar failing in his quest, causing emotional distress. These dreams may feature twisted versions of Tymora, Rose’s anger, or horrific consequences of defiance.
2. **Sending Dark Spirits:** The priest sends **shadows**, **specters**, or **wights** to haunt Vidar, attacking him or simply following him and causing fear. These spirits remind him of the consequences of straying from the path.
3. **Curses and Afflictions:** The priest may curse Vidar, causing temporary or long-term afflictions such as:
    - **Blindness** when trying to read holy texts or scriptures of Tymora.
    - **Frostbite** or cold-related damage whenever he steps on sacred ground opposed to the Nightmother.
    - **Necrotic damage** when casting healing spells.
4. **Forcing Possession by Rose:** The Nightmother may use Rose to take full control of Vidar temporarily, forcing him to perform dark deeds he would not normally do, such as attacking allies or performing dark rituals.
5. **Bargaining with Tymora’s Enemies:** The priest might offer information to enemies of **Tymora** or allies of **Strahd**, revealing Vidar’s presence to those who would harm him or use him for their purposes.

---

### **Ways to Break the Curse/Agreement**

Finally, if Vidar wishes to free himself from the curse and the deal with the **Nightmother**, he will need to undertake a perilous journey. Here are a few paths to breaking the pact:

1. **Divine Intervention from Tymora**  
    Vidar could attempt to win back the favor of **Tymora** by performing a great act of faith, such as:
    
    - Recovering a lost artifact of Tymora.
    - Cleansing an important shrine or temple of Tymora in Barovia.
    - Delivering a major boon to someone in desperate need by means of luck or fortune.
    
    Success could result in **Tymora’s divine intervention**, where she severs the connection between Vidar and the Nightmother, possibly at the cost of some of Vidar’s power.
    
2. **Confronting and Defeating the Priest**  
    Vidar could seek to defeat the priest who initially made the deal with him. By destroying this agent of the Nightmother, Vidar could weaken her hold on him enough to begin breaking the curse. However, this would likely trigger a direct confrontation with Rose and the Nightmother herself.
    
3. **Performing a Ritual of Atonement**  
    Vidar could seek out an ancient temple or hidden relic associated with **Tymora** or another deity opposed to the Nightmother. He would need to undergo a dangerous ritual that involves atoning for the dark deeds he’s committed under the Nightmother’s influence. This may involve retrieving an item, defeating a creature, or overcoming a personal trial.
    
4. **Seeking Aid from the Keepers of the Feather**  
    The Keepers of the Feather, with their ties to rebellion and resistance against Strahd, may have access to ancient knowledge or rituals that could break the curse. They might guide Vidar through a series of quests to find a lost relic or defeat a powerful ally of the Nightmother to weaken her influence.
    

---

This structure should provide plenty of tension, opportunity for roleplay, and mechanical impact as Vidar struggles to balance his past, present, and potential future.

1. **Plague of Nightmares**: Vidar experiences vivid and horrific nightmares every night, causing permanent exhaustion if unresolved.
2. **Curse of Doubt**: Vidar suffers **disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks**, sowing confusion in his mind and making it difficult for him to act confidently.
