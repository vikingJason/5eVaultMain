# The New Campaign Layout

With all the additions and changes detailed in this series, I hope to have fixed some of these core issues. And, as modified, this is the new plot we get.

- Firstly, STRAHD CANNOT DIE.
    
    - This is the very first and most important change I made to the campaign. Strahd is quite literally immortal. Not because he’s a vampire, but because he’s connected to a Dark Power. Even if you’ve got a band of level 30 characters all beating him to a pulp, Strahd would simply be resurrected the following dusk. Barovia is eternally under his control and Strahd takes great pleasure in this fact.
        
    - In the second third of the campaign or later, various NPCs can actually state this fact to the players. "Other adventures have come and killed Strahd before, you know. But he comes back. He always comes back..."
        
- Secondly, Strahd is _Obscenely_ Powerful
    
    - He isn't just a high leveled enemy. Even if he weren't immortal from his connection to Vampyr, a team of level 20 PCs would have trouble fighting him.
        
        - There's a popular CR 27 version of Strahd out there if you'd like specific stats. However, just buffing him in every way possible and then giving him every spell on the Wizard list is more than enough to build a working stat block.
            
    - Why is Strahd so powerful? Because of the Fanes of Barovia. Strahd stole power from three very powerful nature goddesses when he desecrated their shrines. This power is why Strahd has control over the elements and weather in Barovia. This power is why Strahd is, "The Land."
        
- And Lastly, Ireena
    
    - Ireena is a PC
        
        - If you can somehow transfer Ireena's narrative function to a PC, eliminating her as an NPC altogether, that'd be ideal. Now, Strahd is after a PC because that player is his reincarnated love. This makes things _very_ personal to the players and makes them the center of the plot.
            
        - If this option is of interest to you, I highly recommend checking out my [Village of Barovia](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8xu9lo/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_the_village_of/) chapter. It details this process more thoroughly.
            
    - Ireena as an NPC Doesn't get a Happy Ending
        
        - I'll detail this more in a later post, but know that Ireena is pretty much doomed. I have some of this written in my [Village of Barovia Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8xu9lo/fleshing_out_curse_of_strahd_the_village_of/) and will include much more in a future post on the Shrine of the White Sun in Kresk.
            
        - Forcing Ireena into a sad ending basically makes her a martyr for the narrative. Her death or other sad fall is no different from that obligatory parent murder in the beginning of so many action movies. Tragedy breeds heroes.
            

With these three additions, the players can't just go level up until they're ready to kill the big baddie. They'll actually have to _do_ something about Strahd's power and Strahd's immortality if they want to defeat him. And that gives us some plot to work with. ;)



-  Hook Series
	- Players are trapped in Barovia
	* Players get mission to escort Ireena to Vallaki. If a PC has replaced Ireena, they head to Vallaki seeking sanctuary from Strahd. 
	* Players find out they are "the chosen ones" from Madam Eva

    - Building Relationships
        
        - Through role play and adventuring, players are more thoroughly introduced to Barovia and its people.
            
        - Players should grow to love Ireena and a few other NPCs of the DM's integration.
            
        - Players should become an integral part of Vallaki's future, making them care about the citizens there and the future of the town.
            
    - Disaster Motivation
        
        - Players learn how awful Strahd really is and genuinely come to hate him. He's been a passive name and possible chore so far, but now, they actively want him dead. They feel this way because:
            
        - Somehow, Strahd messed with Vallaki and the town they care about.
            
        - Strahd has started messing with the players, trying to turn them against each other or otherwise hurting them, making things personal.
            
        - Strahd captures Ireena, making the party want to rescue her.
            
        - Ireena somehow dies, invoking Strahd's wrath on the party. Players are pushed into a kill or be killed scenario for the rest of the campaign. Luckily, Strahd likes to play with his food and won't kill them right away.
            
    - Figuring Things Out
        
        - The players follow a series of hooks from one location to another where they piece together important information. The quests for the prophesied items and the ally should facilitate these hooks.
            
        - The players discover, vaguely, that Strahd's power is not his own and that he is truly immortal. However, they still do not know how to undo that.
            
        - Eventually, they get hooked into the Amber Temple. The Amber Temple will tell the players how to reconsecrate the Fanes, weakening Strahd, and how to unhook Strahd from Vampyr, making Strahd permanently killable.
            
    - The Endgame
        
        - Players make their way to Castle Ravenloft, reconsecrating the Fanes on the way.
            
        - This will also include some quick revisits to various locations in Barovia. The players can revisit some beloved NPCs if they chose, preparing themselves for the final battle and hardening their will.
            
        - Players face Strahd and Vampyr in Castle Ravenloft.
            
        - Barovia is freed from the mist and Strahd is dead.
            
- This is the most basic and shortest version of the plot I could write for you guys. Of course, there're still side quests and loads of plot in between, but at least now those quests actually lead somewhere. Now, players might confront the Abbott because they're searching for information on the Dark Powers. Now, the players might help the Martikovs at the winery in return for information on the Fanes. The players get to have _plot._ Imagine that!
    
- Additionally, adding a Vampyr fight to the end of the game gives the players a big baddie that's _not_ on the cover. It's a name they'll only learn in the last stage of the campaign, making things a bit more surprising.
