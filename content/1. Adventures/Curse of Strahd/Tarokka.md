### 1 - Tome of Strahd
Three of Stars—Enchanter

I see a kneeling woman—a rose of great beauty plucked too soon. The master of the marsh knows of whom I speak.

The treasure lies under Marina's monument in Berez (chapter 10, area U5). "The master of the marsh" refers to Burgomaster Lazlo Ulrich (area U2), whose ghost can point characters toward the monument.

### 2 - The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind
Two of Swords—Paladin

I see a sleeping prince, a servant of light and the brother of darkness. The treasure lies with him.

The treasure lies in Sergei's tomb (chapter 4, area K85).

### 3 - The Sunsword
Two of Stars—Diviner

Look to the one who sees all. The treasure is hidden in her camp.

The treasure lies in Madam Eva's encampment (chapter 2, area G). If she is the one performing the card reading, she says, "I think the treasure is under my very nose!"

### 4 - Strahd's Enemy
Executioner (Jack of Spades)

Seek out the brother of the devil's bride. They call him "the lesser," but he has a powerful soul.

This card refers to Ismark Kolyanovich (see chapter 3, area E2). Ismark won't accompany the characters to Castle Ravenloft until he knows that his sister, Ireena Kolyana, is safe.

### 5 - Strahd
Artifact (Joker 1)

He lurks in the darkness where the morning light once shone—a sacred place.

Strahd faces the characters in the chapel (area K15).
