## Session Overview 


The party took stock after the recent fight, searching around the room for any signs that would lead them to the missing bones of St Andral.

Vidar cast a spell to aid him detect magic, and even though it didn't help him find the relics, it did illuminate a small infernal looking creature that was hiding it's visibility with the use of magic.

As the invisible Imp tried to leave the room, presumably to report back to it's master, Vidar launched an attack at the fiend.

The ensuing fight was quick. Lars was even quicker to close and lock the only door to the room.

A scratching sound at the door had Lars on edge. They bravely open the door to see a rat scurrying across the dirt floor of the cellar. Lars steps on the rodent with his boot, making a loud squishing noise as it's entrails splatter across the ground.

Seeing no imminent signs of danger, they make their way to the cellar door only to find it locked from the outside.

They take the second set of stairs that lead into the Wachterhaus. Iron torch sconces cling to the wall of this stone staircase that cuts its way into a small room in the heart of the old house.

Servants’ coats and aprons hang from hooks in the room, and boots are neatly lined up against the wall.

They continue to silently move through the house, looking for a way out. They find a potential escape route in a room where the furnishings are bereft of imagination: four simple beds with equally austere wooden chests.

Lars opens the window and climbs out, Vidar starting to follow but they are spotted by Lady Wachter's spy Ernst who attacks. His cunning works against him, stepping just outside the room to fire his crossbow at the group, Marcus and Aeli work together to close the door and barricade it with one of the beds. 

Once outside, they quickly moves through the streets of Vallaki to the Burgomaster's mansion.

They met with the Baron, informing him of the evidence they had gathered against Lady Wachter and her cult. To facilitate her arrest, the visitors offer to be deputised into the Town Guard so they can act in an official capacity.

Baron Vargas Vallakovich excitedly agreed, searching for the oath they must swear. Not finding the copy in his desk, he excuses himself and heads to Izek’s bedroom.

Peering into the room, Aeli and Sorrow see that the Captains room is full of pretty little dolls with powder-white skin and auburn hair, some of them dressed beautifully, others plainly. Some of the dolls fill a long bookshelf, and others are arranged in neat rows on wall-mounted shelves. Still others are piled atop a bed and a heavy wooden chest. What’s most odd is that all of the dolls, apart from their clothing, look the same.

It takes a moment, but it finally dawns on them that they all look like Ireena.

The Baron finds what he was looking for, and returns to his Library so that Vidar, Sorrow, Aeli and Lars can recite the oath becoming fully fledged members of the Vallaki Town Guard.

> **"The Oath of Vigilance"**
>
> *“I, [Name], stand here before the people of Vallaki, before my comrades, and before the powers of this land, to take up arms in defense of this town. With solemn heart and unwavering will, I swear this oath.”*
>
>**"I am the shield of Vallaki."** 
>*No harm shall reach our people so long as I breathe and fight.*
>*No shadow shall corrupt our town so long as I stand guard.*
>*No enemy shall break our spirit so long as I hold this line.*
>*This I swear, with my life and my honor. In shadow or in light, I am the guard of Vallaki.*
>
>*So it is sworn. So it shall be.”

Determined, the party head to the Wachterhaus to arrest Lady Wachter.

Undecided on the strategy, Lars approaches the front door knocking loudly. As he pounds on the door, it opens slowly creaking loudly.

He enters, followed closely by Aeli. Keeping a careful ear out for anyone that may be lurking in wait to ambush them, Lars hears the sound of metal rattling and dashes towards it.

He bursts into the kitchen, the empty room looking as if they servants had been rushed out in the middle of their dinner preparations. Lars finds the source of the noise, a kettle boiling violently on the stove. 

With the coast clear, Aeli calls out to the rest of the party still outside. Vidar and Sorrow enter the house and creep up the flight of stairs to the second floor, with Lars and Aeli close behind while Marcus waits outside.

Vidar reaches the top of stairs to a hallway with a window at each end and framed portraits and mirrors that festoon the wall and surround him with judging looks and dark reflections.

Before they can move further into the hallway, they are ambushed by Ernst and the escaped Cultist.

Crossbow bolts and arrows flying back and forth shattering windows, alerts Marcus and he heads inside to check on his friends.

Throughout the fight there is a collage of loud cracks from Aeli's whip, the flashes of light reflecting off Sorrow's silver sword, and the shimmering field that surrounds and protect the cultist.

With the spy and the cultist dealt with, they begin their search of rooms upstairs.

Sorrow makes her way into a room that is musty and dark. An iron-framed bed fitted with leather straps stands near a wall with no other furnishings.

Scurrying away from Sorrow on all fours is a young woman in a soiled nightgown. She leaps onto the bed and hisses like a cat. “Little kitty doesn’t know you!” she shouts. “Little kitty doesn’t like the smell of you!”

Sorrow decides that now is not the time to try and fix whatever is causing her madness and they will come back from the poor girl.

Vidar and Lars manage to unlock a set of double doors into a room crawling with cats. Bookshelves hug the walls, but most of the shelves are bare. Other furnishings include a desk, a chair, a table, and a wine cabinet. The room has an irregular shape, and none of its angles seem quite right, as though the shifting of the house has set the whole place on edge.

Lars notices that one cat has a small key hanging from its collar and uses his ration to attract it to him so they can slip the key from around its neck.

There are two identical bedrooms that contain nothing out of the ordinary: a neatly made bed, a table with an oil lamp on it, a handsome wooden chest, a slender wardrobe, and a window box with drapes.

Sorrow and Aeli, standing before the last remaining door. Sorrow fiddles with her tools, picking the lock and opens the door into the master bedroom.

Across from the door, a fire sputters and struggles for life in the hearth, above which hangs a framed family portrait: a noble father and mother, their two young sons, and a baby daughter in the father’s arms. The sons are smiling in a way that suggests mischief. The parents look like uncrowned royalty.

Wood paneling covers the walls of the room. A closet and a framed mirror flank a curtained window to the south. To the north, a wide, canopied bed lies pinned between matching end tables with oil lamps. Stretched out on one side of the bed is a man dressed in black, his eyes each covered with a copper piece. He bears a striking resemblance to the father in the painting.

Next to the man in the bed is a sleeping Lady Wachter.

Sorrow and Aeli sneak in, approaching the lady of the house carefully ready to subdue and restrain her. At side of the bed, their goal within arms reach, Lady Wachter's eyes suddenly open.

Is she smiling?






The party gathered themselves, their breaths steadying as they surveyed the aftermath of the skirmish, eyes darting over the shadowed corners of the room for any sign of the missing relics—the sacred bones of St. Andral.

Vidar, undeterred, whispered words of magic, extending his senses. His spell, meant to illuminate and traces of magic. His gaze fell upon a faint, infernal shimmer—a lurking, concealed creature that had eluded their notice until now. Its beady eyes flickered as it watched the invaders of this room. The imp, began to scuttle toward the door, its tiny, clawed feet barely skimming the floor.

Vidar struck first, his magic flashed out. The fight was swift and brutal, Lars bolting the door just as quickly to trap their quarry within.

A scuttling sound scratched against the wood. Lars’s hand hovered near his weapon, ready—but only a rat scurried from beneath the frame, crossing the cellar floor with frantic little feet. Without a second thought, Lars’s boot met it with a crunch, a smear of entrails left in its wake. The room fell silent once more.

Satisfied, the party made their way to the cellar's exit, only to find it barred from the outside. They exchanged glances, knowing this would be no simple escape. Taking the stone stairwell that led upward, they ascended into the Wachterhaus, a house thick with secrets and heavy silence. Along the walls, iron sconces cast shadows that danced, and from hooks in the entry room hung coats and aprons, hints of the servants who ghosted through the house.

They crept forward, alert. The air smelled of stale dust, the furniture arranged with an almost militaristic precision. They slipped into a room of four austere beds, each as unadorned as the next. Lars tested a nearby window, pushing it open, and began his climb. Vidar moved to follow him out, but a whisper of movement caught his eye.

Ernst, Lady Wachter’s loyal spy, stood poised to strike, crossbow drawn. Marcus and Aeli, quick to act, forced the door shut and dragged a bed across it, locking him out. Ernst's curses could be heard from within, but they were already slipping away, darting down alleys as the house fell behind them, a dark blot on the horizon of Vallaki.

Under the waning light, they found their way to the Burgomaster's mansion, presenting their findings to Baron Vargas Vallakovich with solemn urgency. Lady Wachter’s treachery, her alliance with dark cults—these accusations left little room for doubt. At the mention of deputizing them, Vargas’s face lit up with sudden, eager resolve. He rummaged through his desk, unable to locate the town’s ancient oath, before excusing himself to retrieve a copy from Izek’s quarters.

Aeli and Sorrow exchanged uneasy glances as they peered into the room after him. Every wall, every corner was littered with delicate, porcelain dolls. Their powder-white skin and auburn hair captured the likeness of the same woman. The legion of dolls, some finely dressed, others plain, but all bearing that same, haunting face: Ireena.

The Baron returned with a worn piece of parchment—the words of Vallaki’s ancient oath of vigilance. Vidar, Sorrow, Aeli and Lars, in turn, pledged their loyalty.

As fresh members of the Vallaki guard, they returned to the Wachterhaus, this time with authority, though not entirely with a plan. Lars, choosing a direct approach, rapped his knuckles on the heavy door, which creaked open under the force. He entered first, Aeli close behind, their steps careful. The sound of rattling metal drew Lars’s attention to the kitchen. He approached with care, only to find a boiling kettle, left to hiss and spit on the stove.

After a tense pause, Aeli called for Vidar and Sorrow, who joined them to continue the ascent. On the second floor, they encountered an eerie hallway lined with gilded mirrors and portraits, eyes that seemed to follow them with a cold judgment.

Before they could advance, Ernst and a cultist sprang from a hidden alcove, bolts flying. Glass shattered, mirrors cracked, and the fight became a blur of flashing steel, Sorrow’s silver sword cutting through the air as Aeli’s whip snapped with lethal grace. A shimmering field surrounded the cultist, deflecting blow after blow until it finally shattered under Vidar's unyielding assault. With a final clash, the foes fell, and silence once more returned to the hall.

In the darkened upper rooms, their search led them to a cramped, musty chamber. Sorrow slipped inside, her eyes falling upon a strange sight—a young woman in a tattered nightgown, crouched on all fours like a feral creature. She hissed, baring her teeth. “Little kitty doesn’t know you!” she shrieked. “Little kitty doesn’t like the smell of you!” Sorrow backed away, feeling the weight of the girl’s madness, knowing that she was yet another of Lady Wachter’s twisted legacies.

In the library, Lars discovered that one of the many feline companions had a key tied around its neck. Coaxing it with a scrap of ration, he retrieved the key, an unexpected treasure in a house that seemed bent on denying them every answer.

At last, they stood before the final door—the master bedroom. Sorrow’s deft hands worked the lock, and it swung open to reveal a room cloaked in shadows, a flickering hearth casting dim light over the cold, stately furnishings. A portrait hung above the fire, capturing a noble family frozen in a moment of faded glory. The father and mother, stern; their sons with sly, knowing smiles.

On the bed lay a man, his eyes covered with copper coins, his likeness unmistakably that of the man in the painting. Lady Wachter slept beside him, peaceful as a queen in repose.

But as Sorrow and Aeli crept closer, her eyes opened. A smirk twisted the corner of her mouth, cold and unsettling. They froze, feeling the chill of her gaze.

Was she smiling?
