## Session Overview 


In the dead of night, Marcus, Lars and Aeli arrived at the tower on the lake.

There is an additional brightly coloured caravan on this visit that Lars recognised from the Arasek Stockyard in Vallaki. The sign on this new wagon confirmed it belongs to Rictavio, the party relieved that there is some positive news from the days harrowing events.

Marcus, cautious after the last visit here, inspected every inch of the exterior to Ezmerelda's wagon. The Wizard found no traps or warnings, but did find a secret door underneath the wagon, a peculiar sight indeed.

Unwilling to let history repeat itself, Marcus stood back at a safe distance with Ireena and Kasimir while Lars and Aeli approached the handless iron door to the tower. The pair studied the large symbol embossed into it's centre, depicting a connected series of lines with eight stick figures set around it.

To everyone's delight, Lars began to move his arms and legs about, as if performing a common dance back from his home town. The rusty hinges groaned as the door swung open.

The flagstone floor was strewn with debris, and a few old crates stood near the east wall. In the centre of the floor was a square indentation containing four pulleys attached to taut iron chains that stretch up through a similarly sized hole in the rotted wooden ceiling. Standing next to the chains were four tall clay statues.

They quickly deduced that this must be some sort of device to move between the floors of the dilapidated building, but they were unsure of how to operate the contraption.

Lars and Marcus stood on the platform, wanting, hoping, to find a way up. The statues began moving, pulling on the chains in unison. The platform jerked as it began to slowly rise with Lars and Marcus keeping balance.

As the platform continued to rise, it moved like a fishing boat caught in a wild storm on the open water that worsened with each level of the tower they reached. As they passed the third floor, Lars' balance betrayed him and he fell from the platform to the rotting wooden floor.

The floor boards croaked and groaned beneath his weight and snapped underneath him, Lars fell to the wooden floor of the story below him.

Marcus called out in concern. Aeli heard the commotion above but could not tell if her friends were ok.

As Lars scanned the room around him, the wood beneath him again showed signs of fatigue and the sounds of the splintering fibres crescendoed into loud cracks as the floor gave way and Lars hit the stone floor of the ground level hard.

The platform stopped moving, Marcus scanned the room around him. Unlike the levels below, this room showed signs of habitation, and although it reeked of mold and mildew, it had plenty of creature comforts. A cozy bed, bright tapestries, and a large iron stove with plenty of wood to feed it. 

Standing behind a desk with matching chair was Rictavio, a welcoming smile upon his face, Piccolo curled up cozily by his feet. 

Aeli helped Lars onto the platform with Ireena and Kasimir, and they held on tight as they rode to join Marcus at the top of the tower.

Rictavio revealed himself to be none other than Rudolph van Richten,  a legendary and revered vampire hunter. He confessed that he had come to Barovia some time ago to kill Strahd von Zarovich, the greatest vampire of them all.

Van Richten brandished his journal, it contained the notes he gathered from all his years of studying Strahd. His story evident of an intense devotion to his cause, however Van Richten's practicality and survival instincts proved to him that he can’t hope to best the vampire in a straight-up confrontation: he had to wait for the right moment to strike. 

His time  recently has been spent looking for allies, such as the Keeper's of the Feather who oppose Strahd, as well as taking out as many of Strahd's spies as he can, starting with evil Vistani.

Knowing that he isn’t a young man anymore and that his road is coming to an end but his work isn't done, the vampire hunter handed over his journal, as if passing over a ceremonial torch to continue to spread light and eradicate darkness. Van Richten confidently assures Lars, Marcus and Aeli, that there arrival is the perfect opportunity to complete the mission he can not.

Lars began flipping through the journal, citing evidence gathered that Strahd periodically hibernates in his coffin, sometimes for years, when all is quiet in the realm. According to the notes, it seemed that van Richten was able to hide in plain sight with the aid of a *hat of disguise*, and protect his thoughts by a *ring of mind shielding*.

The hour grew late, van Richten welcomed the group to spend the night in the safety of his tower, a hospitality which they gladly accepted.

---

During the night, a faint voice woke Marcus from his slumber. The voice called out to him, reminded Marcus of what he must do! He was in the house of van Richten the assassin, who was asleep and defenceless. The voice urged him, the time was right, he could dispose of this hunter and fulfil his agreement.

As if she could read his thoughts, Macus felt Piccolo's eyes staring at him. The sabre-toother tiger's looming figure showed it was comfortable but ready to strike at the first sign of danger to her master.

Marcus decided that it was safer to drift back to sleep.

---
---

In the morning, the dim skies provided little promise of glorious sunshine while Marcus, Aeli and Lars discussed where they should head next.

If the rumours were true and the Amber Temple is where Strahd gained his powers, then it was too dangerous to visit right now, they knew they needed to prepare themselves further to face the Dark Powers within.

Strahd's invitation to dinner was far from their minds.

Ezmerelda had given no clue where she had retreated to after a brief stop in Vallaki to search for her master. Hearing that his protege had come looking for him concerned van Richten, musing that she must have found something extremely valuable to Strahd - why else would she risk her life to come find him.

Certain that these newcomers to Barovia  possessed the strength and abilities to defeat Strahd, van Richten took a key hanging from a simple leather cord around his neck. He opened a chest beside his bed, taking out a leather-bound tome beaming with intrigue.

![[23. 17th January - More Truths are Revealed-20250126155316381.webp]]

"This is the Tome of Strahd!" he exclaimed, "an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state."

The pages looked old and brittle but held powerful secrets to those that could decipher it. Hit by a spark of curiosity, Lars enquired if there were other power relics that they could gather to help them defeat the Lord of Barovia.

Van Richten knew of two other such items, The *Sunsword*, a unique blade once possessed by Strahd’s brother, Sergei von Zarovich. And the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*, a unique platinum amulet shaped like the sun, with a large crystal embedded in its center, sacred to the good-hearted faithful of Barovia.

The vampire hunter knew not where either of the items were, but assured them that if they could locate them, their victory against Strahd was all but certain.

A thought struck Lars, Sergei was a name he had heard before. A traveller he met on the road, a member of the Order of the Silver Dragon, mentioned it to him, referencing Argynvostholt.

But how could this be? He probed for more details, van Richten shared that Sergei was a member of the knightly order but was betrayed by his brother. He reassured that Sergei was not a Vampire, and spoke of the cruel torture inflicted on Barovia where souls were not permitted to leave. Some souls are reborn into new-born babies, forced to continue an ever repeating cycle. Others proved too stubborn to let death chose their fate so would take residence in the body of a fallen hero and become what was known as a Revnant.

It was possible that Sergei was one of those souls. Argynvostholt was their best lead, if Sergei was there he may be able to tell them where the Sunsword is, at the very least there could be some clues. A brief memory of the fortunes told flashed through Aeli's mind, but the details foggy.

They quickly headed downstairs to start their journey.

Lars climbed into Ezmerelda's wagon through the trapdoor underneath, breathing a sign of relief that they had not set off the booby trap inside, a flask of alchemist’s fire hanging from the wagon’s ceiling and connected by wire to the inside of the door handle.

Inside the wagon was a stash of useful equipment.
- A wooden trunk covered with claw marks
- A narrow wardrobe
- A climber’s kit, a disguise kit, a healer’s kit, and a poisoner’s kit
- A lyre with golden strings
- A sculpted wooden cage holding a chicken and a silver ewer with five chicken eggs in it
- A tiny wooden box
- A set of copper pots and pans
- Three sets of manacles
- A shovel
- A wooden chest
- Two scrolls
- A parchment roll case
- A charred page from van Richten’s journal

Before Lars could take stock of everything, a loud howl pierced the sounds of the surrounding forest.

Lars, Aeli, Marcus, with Ireena and Kasimir by their sides, prepared for whatever danger approached.

Across the land bridge, a wolf stood defiantly and starred at the group. Seconds passed and the solitary wolf was joined by the rest of the pack, standing side by side with teeth bared.

Anger swelled withing Lars, who took aim with his bow and let loose.

The wolves charged!

Marcus summoned a great blast of fire at the incoming beasts.

Some of the wolves began to take a different shape as they rushed forward, it was not just wolves they faced, Werewolves.

The fight was tough, Lars hacked and slashed with his trusty club and sword. Aeli cut through wolf hide with her longsword. Ireena courageously faced her enemies with club in hand. Kasimir summoned his powers to rain down the elements on the beasts. Marcus proved deadly, not just with his spells, but even his daggers as he took down his adversaries.

As the last werewolf fell, Lars noticed a swatch of fabric in it's pocket - the same fabric that Sigrit's dress was made of. For a moment Lars was lost to his own primal instincts, delivering blow after blow to the already defeated enemy.

#### Session Notes

The moonlight shimmered faintly across the lake’s surface as Marcus, Lars, and Aeli approached the lonely silhouette of the tower. The air was damp with mist, and the faint croak of frogs added an eerie cadence to their footsteps. But tonight, amidst the uncertainty and dangers that stalked the roads of Barovia, there was a glimmer of hope—a brightly colored caravan parked near the tower. Lars recognized it instantly from Vallaki’s Arasek Stockyard. The sign confirmed it belonged to Rictavio. Relief rippled through the group like the first warmth of dawn after a freezing night.

Marcus, ever cautious, took the lead. The wizard’s sharp eyes scanned every inch of Ezmerelda’s wagon. No traps, no magical sigils—not this time. Yet beneath the wagon, his fingers brushed against something unexpected: a concealed door. A puzzle for another time, he thought, his focus returning to the iron door of the tower.

The handless door loomed before them, its strange embossed design catching the moonlight. Eight stick figures encircled a web of interconnected lines. Lars stepped forward, his brow furrowed in concentration. Then, with an almost boyish grin, he began to move—arms swinging, legs stepping in a deliberate rhythm. A dance. The group exchanged bemused glances, but when the door groaned open, creaking on rusted hinges, they couldn’t argue with success.

Inside, the tower's hollow shell revealed its age. The flagstone floor was littered with debris, and wooden crates huddled against the walls like forgotten relics. At the room's center, a peculiar mechanism caught their attention: a square indentation in the floor, iron chains stretched taut, leading upward into darkness. Beside the chains, four clay statues stood sentinel, their expressions blank yet somehow unnerving. The group quickly deduced the mechanism’s purpose—a crude elevator of sorts, powered by the statues.

Marcus and Lars stepped onto the platform, curiosity outweighing caution. With a lurch, the statues moved in unison, their hands pulling the chains as the platform began its ascent. The ride was anything but smooth. The platform swayed violently, creaking like a ship in a storm. As they passed the third floor, Lars lost his footing. He tumbled backward, the wooden floor snapping beneath his weight.

“Lars!” Marcus shouted, his voice echoing through the hollow tower.

Lars hit the floor below hard, the air knocked from his lungs. But the wood was treacherous, groaning under his weight. Before he could rise, the boards gave way again, sending him crashing to the ground floor. Dazed but alive, he coughed, trying to orient himself amidst the debris.

Aeli helped Lars onto the platform with Ireena and Kasimir, and they held on tight as they rode the elevator to join Marcus at the top of the tower.

Above, Marcus clung to the platform as it reached the tower’s summit. The room he found was a stark contrast to the desolation below. A cozy bed was tucked in one corner, its blankets neatly arranged. Bright tapestries adorned the walls, and a sturdy iron stove radiated faint warmth. Behind a desk sat a figure—a man with sharp eyes and a welcoming smile. At his feet, a sabre-toothed tiger slept soundly, curled into a ball of fur.

“Welcome,” the man said warmly. “You’ve made it!”

Rictavio—or rather, Rudolph van Richten—revealed himself at last. His voice carried the weight of decades of experience, tempered by a hint of weariness. He spoke of his mission: a lifelong crusade to end Strahd von Zarovich’s reign. Van Richten’s hands moved with precision as he laid out his journal, a repository of hard-won knowledge.

“I’ve spent years studying him,” van Richten said, his tone measured. “Strahd is no ordinary foe. He’s cunning, patient. He hibernates in his coffin when the realm is quiet, but don’t mistake that for weakness. And he always has spies.” His eyes darkened. “That’s why I’ve targeted the Vistani who serve him.”

Lars, Marcus, and Aeli listened intently, the weight of the mission settling heavily on their shoulders. Van Richten spoke of his allies—the Keepers of the Feather—and the magic that had shielded him: a *hat of disguise* to blend in and a *ring of mind shielding* to guard his thoughts.

“I can’t do this alone,” he admitted, his voice softening. “My time is running out. But you—you’re here. And that means something.”

He handed over the journal, his hands steady despite the enormity of the gesture. “Take this. It’s yours now. The knowledge, the fight—it belongs to you.”

The group accepted the journal with solemn gratitude. As Lars flipped through its pages, he caught glimpses of Van Richten’s meticulous notes: maps, observations, and theories. One passage detailed the vulnerabilities of Strahd’s hibernation; another outlined the habits of his spies.

The hour grew late, the night outside thick with an oppressive silence. Van Richten offered them sanctuary for the evening, his tower a haven amidst the darkness of Barovia. For the first time in days, the group felt a flicker of hope—not the blinding light of triumph, but the steady glow of determination. Strahd’s shadow loomed large, but now they carried the wisdom of a hunter who had walked this path before them. And that, they knew, was a light worth fighting for.

---

The night was still, heavy with Barovia's ever-present mist that wrapped the tower like a suffocating shroud. Marcus stirred in his bedroll, his sleep uneasy. A voice, faint as a whisper carried on a dying wind, called to him.

"Marcus..." it coaxed, both soothing and unnervingly familiar. "You know what must be done. The hunter sleeps—defenseless. You are in his house. Fulfill the agreement."

The words slithered into his thoughts, coiling around his resolve. He sat upright, sweat beading on his forehead despite the cold. His hand unconsciously reached toward the hilt of his blade.

Across the room, Piccolo's feline eyes glinted in the dim light of the stove's embers. The saber-toothed tiger stretched languidly, her muscles rippling beneath her fur, but her gaze was fixed—watchful. Ready. Her quiet presence radiated a warning: *Try it, and you'll regret it.*

The voice urged again, louder this time, pressing against the walls of Marcus's mind. But as the tiger's tail flicked, slicing through the silence, Marcus felt his resolve falter. The danger was too great, the timing too fragile. Slowly, he lay back down, his heart thudding against his ribs as he forced himself to drift into uneasy sleep.

---
---

When the pale, muted light of dawn seeped through the tower’s cracks, it brought no warmth—only the grim reminder of Barovia’s ceaseless gloom. Over a sparse breakfast, Marcus, Aeli, and Lars deliberated their next steps.

The Amber Temple loomed in their thoughts like a dark monolith, a place of ancient power and ruin. If the rumors were true, it was where Strahd had first made his bargain with the Dark Powers, the source of his monstrous transformation. They admitted they were not ready to set foot in there yet.

Strahd’s earlier invitation to dinner felt like a distant memory, a perfumed letter laced with poison. They had no intention of accepting right now.

Ezmerelda’s disappearance lingered in their minds, a puzzle they couldn’t yet solve. Van Richten frowned deeply when they told him she’d come searching for him in Vallaki.

“She would not have come without cause,” he mused, his eyes shadowed with worry. “Ezmerelda is no fool. If she risked seeking me out, it means she’s found something important—something Strahd doesn’t want her to have.”

The weight of his words hung in the air. Then, as if resolving to trust them fully, van Richten rose from his seat and unfastened a simple leather cord around his neck. From it hung a small, unassuming key.

He moved to a battered chest at the foot of his bed. The lid creaked open to reveal an ancient tome, its leather binding cracked with age. He laid it on the table with reverence.

“This,” he declared, “is the *Tome of Strahd*. A record of the vampire’s own hand—a tale of ambition, tragedy, and corruption. Within these pages are secrets, vulnerabilities, and truths that can aid you in his defeat.”

Lars ran a hand over the brittle pages, his fingers trembling slightly. The words, penned in a flowing but dark hand, seemed to pulse with an eerie power.

“What else?” Lars asked, his voice filled with a spark of determination. “Are there other tools we can use against him?”

Van Richten nodded solemnly. “Two relics,” he said, his voice grave. “The *Sunsword* and the *Holy Symbol of Ravenkind*. The first was once the blade of Strahd’s own brother, Sergei von Zarovich, before he was betrayed. The second is an ancient amulet, sacred to the people of Barovia.”

“Do you know where they are?” Aeli pressed, leaning forward.

“I do not,” van Richten admitted. “But if you can find them, they will be your greatest allies.”

Lars furrowed his brow, the name Sergei tugging at a distant memory. A traveller on the road, a knight of the Order of the Silver Dragon, had spoken of him in connection to Argynvostholt.

“Sergei was a knight?” Lars asked, his voice tinged with disbelief.

“Indeed,” van Richten confirmed. “Before Strahd’s fall, Sergei was a member of the Order. But his life—and death—were steeped in tragedy.”

He went on to explain the curse of Barovia: how the souls of its dead were trapped, unable to escape the realm’s cruel cycle. Some, too stubborn to fade, clung to life in broken forms—revenants.

“Could Sergei be one of them?” Lars asked, his mind racing.

Van Richten shrugged. “It’s possible. If so, he may reside at Argynvostholt. If you go there, you may find the blade—or, at the very least, the next piece of your puzzle.”

Aeli’s thoughts drifted to Madam Eva’s cryptic fortunes, the cards hinting at a sacred blade and the lair of a dragon.

As they prepared to leave, the tower’s creaking staircase echoed under their boots. Outside, the mist pressed against the world like a suffocating veil, and the distant howl of wolves promised no safe roads.

Van Richten stood at the door, his figure framed by the dim light. His expression was equal parts solemn and hopeful. “I’ve done all I can,” he said, his voice steady. “The rest is up to you. Find the relics. Defeat Strahd. Free Barovia.”

With the *Tome of Strahd* in hand and a flicker of hope ignited in their hearts, the party descended the steps, their path shrouded in uncertainty but fortified by purpose.

Lars crouched beneath the trapdoor of Ezmerelda's wagon. With a steadying breath, he reached for the latch and gently eased it open, half-expecting the sharp hiss of an unseen trap. But silence greeted him, save for the faint clink of a flask swaying above—a flask of alchemist’s fire, suspended by a web of wire that could ignite catastrophe with the flick of a careless hand.

Relief washed over him as he slipped inside, eyes scanning the wagon’s shadowy interior. Here was no ordinary abode, but a treasure trove of utility and mystery, each item whispering of lives lived on the edge of peril. A wooden trunk bore scars like the talons of some long-dead beast. A narrow wardrobe, standing silent sentinel, hinted at disguises yet to be donned. Kits for climbing, healing, and poisoning were neatly arrayed, tools of survival in a land where death walked freely.

Among the more peculiar finds, a lyre with strings of spun gold rested in a corner, alongside a sculpted wooden cage housing a chicken—a living, clucking anachronism—and a silver ewer cradling five eggs, gleaming like treasures of a forgotten age. A tiny wooden box caught Lars’s attention, its latch a whisper of secrets, but before he could delve deeper, the mournful cry of a wolf shattered the forest's fragile peace.

He froze. Outside, the others—Aeli, Marcus, Ireena, and Kasimir—turned as the sound echoed across the land bridge. The wolf’s cry was answered, not by one but many. From the mist, the pack emerged, their eyes burning with feral intelligence. The leader, a massive, slate-gray beast, stood at the vanguard, its gaze locked on the group. Seconds stretched into an eternity before the pack joined it, their bodies a wall of snarling menace.

Lars’s anger flared like a spark to dry tinder. He drew his bow, the string taut as he loosed an arrow with unerring precision. The wolves surged forward, the air alive with their snarls.

Marcus raised his hands, summoning a torrent of flame that erupted across the bridge, the inferno illuminating the feral forms. Some wolves faltered, but others pushed through, their shapes twisting grotesquely as fur gave way to muscle and claws elongated into wicked talons. These were no ordinary wolves. Werewolves.

The battle unfolded in brutal clarity. Lars fought with a ferocity that matched the beasts’, his club and sword finding purchase in flesh and bone. Aeli moved like a whirlwind, her longsword cleaving through hide and sinew. Ireena, defiant, wielded her club with surprising force, her strikes ringing out amidst the chaos. Kasimir stood at the rear, his hands weaving arcane sigils that summoned ice and fire to crash against the attackers. And Marcus—deadly and precise—alternated between searing flames and the cold bite of his daggers, his movements a dance of lethal efficiency.

When the final werewolf fell, the battlefield stilled, leaving only the rasp of labored breaths and the coppery scent of blood. Lars knelt beside the fallen beast, his eyes catching a swatch of fabric clinging to its tattered clothing. He knew that pattern—Sigrit's dress. The realization struck like a hammer, his mind spiraling into fury.

With a guttural growl, he lashed out at the already defeated enemy, his strikes fueled by something primal and raw. Each blow echoed with an unspoken rage, a fury that felt larger than himself, as though it belonged to the land itself, this cursed and unyielding Barovia.

"Lars," Aeli’s voice cut through the haze, firm but not unkind. Her hand on his shoulder steadied him, pulling him back from the brink.

The swatch of fabric dangled from his clenched fist, a clue and a curse. The forest seemed to hold its breath, as if waiting to see what would unfold next.






#### Van Richten's History
* A scholar and doctor from a land called Darkon, he married his childhood sweetheart, Ingrid, and together they had a son, Erasmus.
* When he was fourteen, Erasmus was stolen away by Vistani and sold to a vampire named Baron Metus to be used as a companion. 
* By the time van Richten found his son, it was too late: the baron had already transformed Erasmus into a vampire spawn. 
* Erasmus begged his father to end his suffering, which van Richten did by pounding a wooden stake through his son’s chest. 
* Baron Metus avenged that deed by killing van Richten’s wife, and van Richten has lived with the horror of his family’s destruction ever since. 
* After destroying Baron Metus in turn, van Richten sought revenge against the Vistani and took up a life of hunting evil monsters.

#### Ezmerelda
Van Richten doesn’t know that his former protégé, a good-aligned Vistana named Ezmerelda d’Avenir, has come to Barovia looking for him. 
He taught her many of his monster-hunting techniques, but she doesn’t know all of his tricks and disguises. So far, their paths haven’t crossed. In the event that van Richten becomes aware of Ezmerelda’s presence, he does his utmost to protect her without putting his own plans in jeopardy. If he can manipulate a party of adventurers into keeping an eye on her, he will do so.

#### The Vampire’s History
- Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. 
- After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family’s enemies. 
- He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. 
- Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. 
- Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. 
- Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. 
- Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality.
- Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. 
- Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his love for her. 
- When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. 
- Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft.
##### Strahd and Tatyana
- Strahd’s attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. 
- Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention. 
- Despite Strahd’s efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. 
- Strahd’s pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple’s love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana’s wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. 
- Strahd murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. 
- He then chased Sergei’s bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. 
- Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd’s pursuit, plunging to her death. 
- Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.
- But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the pact they had made. 
- The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire.
- After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. 
- He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. 
- The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. 
- For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.
- Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. 
- Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts—none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. 
- All of them he turned into vampire spawn. 
- Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort.
- From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire’s game of cat-and-mouse. 
- Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren’t so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.
- Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. 
- He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the Dark Powers to release him.


### Souls and Shells

Barovians are made of flesh and blood. They are born, they live, they age, and they die. But not all of them—only about one in every ten—have souls.

When a being with a soul dies in Barovia, that soul remains trapped in Strahd’s domain until it is reincarnated in a newborn. It can take decades for a bodiless soul to find a host, and Barovians who share the same soul over generations tend to look alike. That is why Ireena Kolyana looks exactly like Strahd’s beloved Tatyana—both women were born with the same soul.

Strahd needs loyal subjects to feed his ego. Barovians without souls are empty shells created by his consciousness to fill out the local population. Although they are physically indistinguishable from Barovians with souls, they tend to be bereft of charm and imagination and to be more compliant and depressed than the others. They dress in drab clothing, whereas Barovians who have souls wear clothes with a splash of color or individuality.

A Barovian woman, soulless or not, can give birth. A child born in Barovia might have a soul even if one or both parents do not. Conversely, the child of two parents with souls isn’t certain to have a soul of its own. Barovians without souls are maudlin folk who experience fear but neither laugh nor cry.

Ireena Kolyana and her brother Ismark both have souls, as do all Vistani. Which Barovians have souls and which don’t is left up to you.

Strahd periodically feeds on the blood of Barovians who have souls, but he can’t draw nourishment from the blood of the soulless. He can tell at a glance whether a Barovian has a soul or is merely a shell.

If Strahd is defeated, the fog that surrounds Barovia fades away, allowing the inhabitants of the valley to leave if they wish. Only those who have souls, however, can truly leave this place. Soulless Barovians cease to exist as soon as they exit the valley.


### Barovian Lore

Typical Barovians know certain facts, or have certain beliefs, about their existence and their surroundings. This common lore is summarized here. Characters can learn this information after earning a Barovian’s trust.

#### The Devil Strahd

About Strahd and vampires, the Barovians believe the following:

- Strahd von Zarovich is a vampire, and he dwells in Castle Ravenloft. No one is welcome at the castle.
- The devil Strahd is a curse placed on the land because of a forgotten sin of the Barovians’ ancestors. (This is untrue, but Barovians believe it nonetheless.)
- A vampire must rest in its coffin during the day. At night, it can summon wolves and vermin to do its bidding. A vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, or a cloud of mist. In its humanoid form, it can dominate you with its powerful gaze.
- A vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
- Running water burns a vampire like acid, and sunlight causes a vampire to burst into flame.

#### The Land of Barovia

Barovians know the following facts about their homeland:

- Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog. Those who don’t turn back perish.
- Many strangers have been drawn to Barovia over the years, but they all die or disappear before long.
- Wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves prowl the Svalich Woods, and hungry bats fill the skies at night.
- The village of Barovia sits at the east end of the valley. Its burgomaster is named Kolyan Indirovich.
- The town of Vallaki lies in the heart of the valley. Its burgomaster is named Baron Vargas Vallakovich.
- The fortified village of Krezk lies at the west end of the valley and is built around an old abbey. The village burgomaster is named Dmitri Krezkov.
- Wine is the lifeblood of Barovia—for some, it is the only reason to keep living. Barovian taverns get their wine from the Wizard of Wines winery near Krezk.
- A mad wizard of great power haunts the foothills of Mount Baratok. He is an outsider and no friend of the vampire’s.


#### Beliefs and Superstitions

Barovians have deep-rooted religious beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:

- Two divine forces watch over the Barovian people: the Morninglord and Mother Night.
- Before the curse of Strahd befell the land, the Morninglord watched over the Barovian people from sunrise until sundown. Now, the sun has not shone unobscured for centuries, and the Morninglord no longer answers their prayers.
- The presence of Mother Night is felt most strongly between dusk and dawn, although nighttime prayers to her go unanswered. It is widely believed that she has forsaken the Barovian people and sent the devil Strahd to punish them for their ancestors’ offenses.
- Spirits drift along the Old Svalich Road toward Castle Ravenloft in the dead of night. These phantoms are all that remain of Strahd’s enemies, and this damnable fate awaits anyone who opposes him.
- The Vistani serve the devil Strahd. They alone are allowed to leave Barovia.
- Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you!


## Vistani

The Vistani (singular: Vistana) are wanderers, traveling about in horse-drawn, barrel-topped wagons, which they build themselves. Compared to Barovians, they are flamboyant, dressing in bright clothes and laughing often. As much as they feel at home in Strahd’s dreary land, they know they can leave it whenever they please and aren’t damned to spend eternity there.

Vistani are silversmiths, coppersmiths, haberdashers, cooks, weavers, musicians, entertainers, storytellers, toolmakers, and horse traders. They also earn money by telling fortunes and selling information. They spend whatever they earn to support a lavish lifestyle, display their wealth openly as a sign of prosperity, and share their good fortune with family and friends.

Each family or clan of Vistani is its own little gerontocracy, with the oldest member ruling the roost. This elder carries the bulk of the responsibility for enforcing traditions, settling disputes, setting the course for the group’s travels, and preserving the Vistani way of life. Vistani elders make all the important decisions, but whether by choice or because of their age, tend to speak in cryptic, flowing riddles.

Vistani families and clans are closely knit. They resolve disagreements through contests that end with reconciliatory singing, dancing, and storytelling. The Vistani are quick to act when their lives or traditions are threatened and are merciless when they believe they must be.

### Strahd’s Vistani Servants

During one of Strahd’s military campaigns, years before he became a vampire, a group of Vistani rescued him after he was wounded in battle. These Vistani not only nursed Strahd back to health but also delivered him safely home. As a reward for their generosity, Strahd declared that all Vistani had the right to come and go from his land as they please, and this privilege extends to the present day. Thus, Vistani can travel freely through the fog that surrounds Barovia, without fear of harm or entrapment.

Strahd honors his debt to the Vistani in part because he envies the Vistani way of life—the freedom they have to go where they please, their devotion to family, and their festive spirit. The courtesy he shows them is not simply a matter of honor but is also born from his admiration of them.

In the centuries since Strahd became a vampire, many Vistani have allowed themselves to be corrupted by Strahd, to the extent that they consider him their king. Vistani who serve Strahd are less lively and friendly than normal Vistani, and their hearts are poisoned with dark intentions. Strahd uses them to lure adventurers into his domain and keep him informed about the events occurring in lands beyond his reach. These Vistani will lie to protect the vampire, and they fear the consequences of disobeying him.

When it comes to sharing information about their dark master, Strahd’s Vistani pretend to be helpful, but the information they impart is misleading at best and often deceptive. They readily tell adventurers that they have a potion that protects them from the deadly fog that surrounds Barovia. Although this is a lie, they attempt to sell their fake potion for as much money as they can get.

### Vistani Lore

Vistani know or believe certain facts about their people and their surroundings. This common lore is summarized here. Characters can learn this information after earning a Vistana’s trust.

#### Strahd von Zarovich

About Strahd, the Vistani believe the following:

- Strahd comes from a royal bloodline. He died centuries ago yet endures as one of the undead, feasting on the blood of the living. Barovians refer to him as “the devil Strahd.”
- Strahd has taken many consorts, but he has known only one true love: a Barovian peasant girl named Tatyana. (The Vistani don’t know what happened to her.)
- Strahd named his castle, Ravenloft, after his beloved mother, Queen Ravenovia. Strangers aren’t welcome at the castle without an invitation.

#### The Land of Barovia

Vistani know the following facts about Barovia and Barovians:

- Strahd conquered this land centuries ago and named it after his father, King Barov. Strahd uses wolves, bats, and other creatures to spy on all of his realm.
- Barovians are simple, frightened people. Some have old souls, but many do not. The soulless ones are easy to spot, for they know nothing but fear. They have no charm, hope, or spark, and they don’t cry.
- The Old Svalich Road passes through Strahd’s domain. Three settlements lie on the road like beads on a string: Krezk to the west, Vallaki in the heart of the valley, and Barovia to the east. Strahd has spies in each settlement.
- There’s an old windmill on the road between the village of Barovia and the town of Vallaki. It should be avoided at all costs! (The Vistani refuse to say more.)
- It is wise to stick to the road. Wild druids, wayward ghosts, and packs of wolves and werewolves haunt the Svalich Woods.

#### Beliefs and Superstitions

The Vistani have deep-rooted beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:

- The souls of those who die in Barovia can’t escape to the afterlife. They are prisoners in Strahd’s domain.
- Some Vistani women are blessed with prescience. Of all the great Vistani fortune-tellers, none compares to Madam Eva. If knowledge of the future is what you seek, Madam Eva will tell you your fate.
- A prescient Vistana can’t see her own future or the future of another Vistana. It is the burden of the Vistani’s great gift that their own fates can’t be divined.
- Vistani curses are potent, but they are invoked with great caution. Vistani know that to curse one who is undeserving of such punishment can have grave consequences for the one who utters such a curse.
- Ravens carry lost souls within them, so killing one is bad luck. (The ravens don’t carry souls within.)

### Vistani Curses

A Vistana, regardless of age, can use an action to utter a curse. The curse targets another creature within 30 feet that the Vistana can see. The Vistana can’t utter another such curse before finishing a long rest.

The curse is a repayment for an injustice or a slight. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the curse. The saving throw DC is 8 + the Vistana’s proficiency bonus + the Vistana’s Charisma modifier. The curse lasts until ended with a [remove curse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2229-remove-curse) spell, a [greater restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2129-greater-restoration) spell, or similar magic. It doesn’t end when the target dies. If a cursed target is returned to life, the curse remains in effect.

When the curse ends, the Vistana suffers a harmful psychic backlash. The amount of this psychic damage depends on the severity of the curse that was invoked.

The Vistana chooses the curse’s effect from the options that follow; other Vistani curses are possible. All such effects deal psychic damage to the Vistani who uttered them when they end:

- The target is unable to perform a certain kind of act involving fine motor control, such as tying knots, writing, playing an instrument, sewing, or casting spells that have somatic components. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.
- The target’s appearance changes in a sinister yet purely cosmetic way. For example, the curse can place a scar on the target’s face, turn the target’s teeth into yellow fangs, or give the target bad breath. When this curse ends, the Vistana it takes 1d6 psychic damage.
- A nonmagical item in the target’s possession (chosen by the DM) disappears and can’t be found until the curse ends. The lost item can weigh no more than 1 pound. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 1d6 psychic damage.
- The target gains vulnerability to a damage type of the Vistana’s choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.
- The target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws tied to one ability score of the Vistana’s choice. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 3d6 psychic damage.
- The target’s attunement to one magic item (chosen by the DM) ends, and the target can’t attune to the chosen item until the curse ends. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.
- The target is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#BlindedCondition), [deafened](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/rules-glossary#DeafenedCondition), or both. When this curse ends, the Vistana takes 5d6 psychic damage.
