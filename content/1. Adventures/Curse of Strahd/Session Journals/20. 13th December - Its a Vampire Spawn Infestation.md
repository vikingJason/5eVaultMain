## Session Overview 


Marcus found his way to the Coffin Maker's store, seeing the door smashed in and a helpless old man tied up inside. There was the familiar sounds of commotion from the second story which could only mean one thing, his friends were in trouble.

Marcus headed upstairs to see his friends were in danger.

The room was infested with these vampire spawns, hiding in the crates scattered throughout the room. Their claws proving deadly, their bite shown to drain the life from anyone bit, and instilling fear as they climbed the walls and roof with ease.

As Aeli, Vidar, Sorrow, Marcus, Ireena and Lars all spread out, the scene became a chaotic symphony of crossbow bolts, swords, clubs and magical attacks against the vile creatures.  

Vidar drew on Tymora's blessings to Turn the Undead creatures away, but the rest of the party did not recognise his strategy, leading to Lars and Vidar falling victim to the draining bite of their foes.

Eventually, when hope was all but lost, it seemed like the last of the Vampire Spawn were defeated. The party split up and quickly resumed their search for the bones that they had been looking for, had been promised were upstairs.

A blood curdling scream from Ireena drew Sorrow to and lead them all to what they were seeking.

Now it was time to take them back to the Father Lucian to make sure these were definitely the relic that he told them about.





Marcus arrived at the Coffin Maker's shop to find the door splintered and hanging loosely on its hinges. Inside, the dimly lit shop carried the smell of sawdust and fear. An old man, bound and trembling, sat in the shadows. Above, the unmistakable echoes of battle—the crash of wood, shouts of exertion, and something else, something sinister—drew Marcus upward. Trouble. It always seemed to find his friends.

Taking the stairs two at a time, Marcus reached the second floor. The scene that greeted him was chaos embodied. Crates lay toppled, their splinters mingling with the cobwebs that hung from the rafters like the remains of an old, broken web. And Vampire spawn—jerky, grotesque things that moved with unnatural speed. Their claws tore through armor, and their fangs glistened with predatory hunger as they hissed and screeched, climbing walls and ceilings as though gravity itself had abandoned them.

The party—Aeli, Vidar, Sorrow, Lars, Ireena, and now Marcus—spread out instinctively, their movements desperate and uncoordinated against the relentless creatures. It was a symphony of survival: the whistle of Sorrow’s crossbow bolts, the hum of Aeli’ sword as it cut through the air, the resounding impact of Lars’ club against undead flesh. Marcus wove through the chaos, his daggers flashing in and out of the fray, every step calculated but urgent.

Vidar, standing firm amid the tumult, called out to Tymora, his voice steady despite the madness. Radiant light poured from his holy symbol, and the power to Turn the Undead surged outward like a wave of cleansing fire. Several of the spawn shrieked and scrambled for the far corners of the room, their movements frantic. But the others pressed on, and the strategy Vidar had hoped for—using the spell to isolate their enemies—went unnoticed by his companions. In their desperation, they fought the creatures still standing, leaving Vidar’s divine protection partially squandered.

Lars swung valiantly but found himself overwhelmed, one of the creatures latching onto him. Its fangs sank deep, draining his vitality and leaving him pale and gasping. Vidar, too, fell prey to their insidious bite, even as he held his holy symbol aloft, trying to shield his friends with the light of his goddess. The room teetered on the brink of defeat, each adventurer pushed to their limit.

And yet, in the way that hope sometimes clings to the edges of ruin, the tide shifted. The last of the vampire spawn fell, its unnatural body crumpling into the dust-laden floor. The party, battered and bloodied, staggered to their feet, exchanging looks of exhaustion and unspoken relief. The threat was vanquished, for now.

But there was no time to rest. The bones. They had been promised that the holy relics were here, somewhere in this room. Splitting up, the group began their search, lifting debris, opening crates, their movements sharp and impatient.

A piercing scream froze them all in place. Ireena’s voice. Sorrow was the first to move, sprinting across the room toward the sound. The others followed, finding Ireena trembling before a hidden alcove. There, cradled in the glow of flickering torchlight, lay the relics they had sought. The Bones of St. Andral.

The room fell silent, save for the labored breathing of the adventurers. They had found what they came for. Now, all that remained was the journey back to Father Lucian, to confirm that these bones were indeed the sacred relics he spoke of. But as they looked at one another, battered and wearied, there was no mistaking the weight of what they had endured—and what still lay ahead.
