## Session Overview 


Lady Wachter had a sinister smile on her face as she awoke, sitting up to face Sorrow and Aeli.

She cast a spell, filling the master bedroom with fiendish looking spirits.

Aeli and Sorrow make quick work of the the ally of Strahd, killing Lady Wachter in her own bed.

Aeli, Vidar and Sorrow search the room for any sign of the stolen relic.

Inspecting the body of Lady Wachter's husband, it is clear that he is dead, but there are no signs of decay, indicating that the death of Lord Wachter must have been very recent.

Opening the door to the closet, they spring a trap and poisoned needles springing out and delivering a dose of poison that knocks Aeli unconscious.

Vidar reacts quickly, using a scroll to repel the poison from Aeli, restoring her.

The closet contains shelves of fancy footwear and many fine garments, including a black ceremonial robe with a hood (similar to the ones worn by the cult fanatics in the cellar). On a high shelf rests a locked iron chest.

After carefully examining the chest for traps, Sorrow opens the chest and sees that it is lined with thin sheets of lead and contains human bones, with a necklace and a silver pendant with something inscribed into it.

Ecstatic that they can return the bones and restore the protective aura of the church, they continue the search of the rooms on the upper level of the Wachterhaur.

Marcus and Lars stand guard in the hallway, vigilantly preparing for the return of the Wachter brothers.

Vidar finds a linen closet, filled with more dust that linens.

They complete another search of the library. The desk contains blank pieces of parchment, quill pens, jars of ink, wax candles, and a wax seal. Vidar, realises that the shelves in the library and mostly bare, and the books that remain aren’t particularly valuable.

Aeli and Sorrow enter the library to aid the search, spotting a section of the bookshelf that stretches along the southernmost wall is actually a secret door on hidden hinges. Aeli pulls the bookshelf open, revealing a doorway that leads to secret storage room.

They check for traps, not wanting to be fooled again, and are relieved to find that it is all clear. Sorrow uses the key that Lars had found around the neck of one of the cats in this room to open the iron chest resting on a bottom shelf.

The iron chest contains several items:
- A silk bag containing 180 ep
- A leather bag containing 110 gp
- A wooden pipe
- Five scrolls
- A supple leather case
- A black leather bound book titled The Grimoire of the Four Quarters
- A very old letter to Lady Lovina Wachter  from one Lord Vasili von Holtz, thanking Lovina for her hospitality, loyalty, and friendship over the years

Inspecting the letter, Sorrow can't quite put her finger on it, but the handwriting looks very familiar.

As the hour grows late, the party quickly depart the Wachter mansion and brave the piercing rain and chilled winds to head to the church. They get the attention of Father Lucian who has been busy trying to comfort and re-assure the villagers who have come to pray and seek refuge. He shares with the group that there is a nasty rumor around town that the Strahd has been spotted in town, but he believes this to be nothing more than a foolish prank.

Vidar explains to the priest what had transpired at Lady Wachter's house, the Cultists, the Imp, Lady Wachter's daughter and the body of Lord Wachter. Father Lucian is distraught to hear this, revealing that Lord Wachter had died over 5 years ago and agreeing to aid  poor Stella Wachter.

The group eagerly show the bones that had been found to the priest, who disappointingly reveals that these are the not the sacred bones of St Andral. The pendant on the necklace has a name, Leo Dilisnya. Father Lucians confirms that he is not familiar with the name and suggests that perhaps the coffin maker, Henrik van der Voort, may have some additional records that they can consult to see who this person is, or was.

They head off to the Blue Water Inn, hoping to locate the Wachter Brothers who have yet been dealt with and may still prove to be a thorn in their sides. The storm grows fierce above, lightning flashes illuminate the streets as it strikes the nearby grounds followed quickly by roaring thunder. As the storms moves closer to Vallaki, a flash of lightning reveals that a shadowy figure is standing right before them and then hidden just as quickly by the darkness of the evening. As the next bolt is thrown at the ground, the figure is gone.

At the Blue Water Inn, a visibly intoxicated Ireena greets her protectors and welcomes them to share the table and some drinks.

Vidar heads to the kitchen for a private conversation with Danika. After learning about the dangers that lurked from within the Wachterhaus and that the town is at risk due to the sacred relic still missing, Danika agrees to have to have some of the Keepers fly around town and aid in the search for Milivoj.

The hostess also reveals that the Wachter brothers were in the Inn earlier, ordered a few bottles of drinks and headed out as they often do, suggesting they could be anywhere really, near their favourite spot on the lake or at the cemetery, but she usually tries to steer clear of them.

Deciding that it is not safe to leave the village after nightfall, the party determine their best bet is to head back to the Wachterhaus and search for anymore clues. They split up to search the rest of the residence, Aeli and Lars taking the stairs up the second level while Sorrow, Marcus and Vidar complete the search of the first floor.

Aeli and Lars leave no stone unturned as they search, but find no clues or anything that might be useful. They do find however that Stella Wachter's room is empty.

Sorrow loots some valuable from the den downstairs, but the group also find nothing that will aid their search. Vidar heads to the cellar, desperate to find any lead and is surprised to find the cultist room is empty, no sign of the bodies of the fanatics they had slain.

The adventures regroup in the dining room and decide to wait and lay a trap from the Wachter brothers. Vidar changing into some of the Lady's fine clothes while Lars heads to the kitchen to cook a feast for his friends so that anyone who arrives will assume that all is well while the group learn their motives or neutralise the threat.

Lars presents the meal to the group who eat it, politely disregarding the blandness of it all. As they eat, there is a knock at the door. Lars lets in a stranger who says that Father Lucian sent him to retrieve Lady Wachter's daughter. Concern grows at this news, as Lars shares that she is already gone.  
With more questions rather than answers the party set off again, back to the grave digger's house in hopes he has returned. Approaching the house, Lars spots a splattering of blood that indicates a recent struggle. Even in the terrible weather he is able to follow the trail, leading the group north towards the Vistani camp just outside the town.



### Session Notes: *A Storm of Secrets*

Lady Wachter’s eyes fluttered open, her lips curling into a sinister smile as if she had been expecting this moment. Aeli and Sorrow stood before her, poised for confrontation. With a flick of her wrist and a whispered incantation, the air in the master bedroom thickened, fiendish spirits swirling into view, their forms flickering between shadow and flame.

The battle was swift and decisive. Sorrow and Aeli's blade struck true, ending Lady Wachter's dark alliance with Strahd in her own bedchamber. The silence that followed felt unnatural, heavy with the weight of something unseen. 

Their search began. Aeli knelt beside the still form of Lord Wachter, whose body was unnervingly intact, the absence of decay hinting at a recent death. The mystery deepened. Aeli opened the closet door, only to trigger a trap. Poisoned needles sprang forth, striking her down in an instant. Vidar reacted without hesitation, invoking a scroll of healing to drive the poison from her veins.

Inside the closet, among the fine garments and ceremonial robes, lay a locked iron chest. Sorrow’s cautious hands dismantled its traps, revealing its grim contents: human bones, a silver pendant etched with the name *Leo Dilisnya*, and a necklace that seemed to pulse faintly in the dim light. The bones brought fleeting hope.

The party pressed onward, methodically exploring the Wachterhaus. In the library, Sorrow’s sharp eyes spotted something amiss: a section of the southern bookshelf revealed itself to be a hidden door. Behind it lay a secret storeroom. Using a key Lars had found earlier, they opened another iron chest, uncovering treasures of both monetary and arcane value: gold and electrum coins, scrolls, and a black leather-bound tome titled *The Grimoire of the Four Quarters*. Among these, a letter from one Lord Vasili von Holtz to Lady Wachter carried a handwriting that pricked at Sorrow’s memory, its familiarity maddeningly just out of reach.

As rain lashed against the cobblestones and thunder roared above, the adventurers left the mansion to report their findings to Father Lucian. The priest, weary from tending to frightened villagers, listened in horror as the group recounted their confrontation with Lady Wachter, her cultists, and the unsettling discovery of her husband’s corpse. Lord Wachter had been dead for years, the priest insisted, and yet the body they found told another story entirely.

Disappointment darkened Father Lucian’s expression when he saw the bones they had recovered. They were not the holy relics the church so desperately needed. Instead, the name *Leo Dilisnya* carved into the pendant posed a new question. The priest suggested consulting Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, for clues in his meticulous official records.

The storm intensified as the party made their way to the Blue Water Inn, hoping to track down the Wachter brothers. Lightning illuminated the streets in blinding flashes, briefly revealing a shadowy figure in their path, only for it to vanish as quickly as it appeared. The tension among them grew, but no immediate threat materialized.

At the inn, an intoxicated Ireena welcomed the group, her attempts at cheer clashing with the storm’s foreboding presence. Vidar slipped away to speak with Danika, the innkeeper. She agreed to deploy the Keepers of the Feather to aid in the search for Milivoj, but her news about the Wachter brothers was less helpful—they had left earlier, possibly heading for the lake or the cemetery.

Determined not to waste the night, the party returned to the Wachterhaus. Upstairs, they found Stella Wachter’s room eerily empty, while the first-floor den yielded little but valuables looted by Sorrow. Vidar’s venture into the cellar revealed something far more troubling: the cultists’ bodies were gone, as if erased from existence.

---

Gathering in the dining room, the group devised a plan to ambush the Wachter brothers. Vidar donned Lady Wachter’s finery as he changed his appearance to initate hers, while Lars prepared a meager feast to set the scene. The facade was barely convincing, but before their trap could spring, an unexpected visitor knocked at the door. The stranger claimed to have been sent by Father Lucian to retrieve Stella Wachter, only to be met with the news of her absence.

As questions piled upon questions, the group set off once more, this time to the grave digger’s house. Outside Milivoj's home, Lars noticed a splatter of blood, its freshness stark against the storm-drenched ground. The trail led north, winding toward the Vistani camp beyond the town’s borders. 

Lightning flashed again, illuminating the dark horizon. Somewhere ahead, the truth waited to be uncovered, shrouded in rain and shadow.
