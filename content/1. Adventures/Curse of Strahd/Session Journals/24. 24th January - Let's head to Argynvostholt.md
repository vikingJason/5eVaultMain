## Session Overview 

Aeli and Marcus shared concern for Lars, whose unspoken rage had subsided and turned to a deep sadness.

Lars admitted that the fabric the werewolf held was from the dress his sister Sigrit was wearing on the day she was taken. Questions arose from Aeli, did they bring Lars' sister to Barovia only to lure her friend? Why? What significance could he hold?

Lars' attention turned to Kasimir, hate had seeded suspicion in the ranger. Lars probed Kasimir about the Vistani that he had been living, accusing him of being in league with those that were in league with Strahd. Kasimir retorted that his allegiance to the Vistani is to the man who welcomed him into his clan, a man named Velikov after he was left for dead centuries ago by Strahd's armies.

Although Velikov passed away more than a century ago, Kasimir continues to live among Velikov’s descendants but has had to hate his hatred for Strahd for fear of reprisal. Kasimir knows that his sister is trapped in Castle Ravenloft, and has now revealed his true allegiances against Strahd in order to save her soul with the help of Aeli, Marus and Lars.

The road to Argynvostholt lay ahead, but the shadows of Barovia would not let them pass without a fight. Marcus and Aeli climbed into Ezmerelda's wagon to see what they could take to aid them on their journey.

Marcus and Aeli sensing that the weapons in the wooden trunk were touched by magic and took, a longsword, hand axe, club, longbow, quiver and mace, leaving a dagger and crossbow behind.

From the wardrobe they took a feathered cloak and a pair of gloves made from the hides of different animals, leaving the short sword and sets of fine clothing in there.

They opened the tiny wooden box as if somehow drawn to the contents inside, a deck of cards wrapped in silk, and as Aeli opened she recognised that this was a tarokka deck similar to what Madam Eva had used to read their fortunes.

Aeli opened the chest and could not decipher what kind of monsters could be hunted with this kit. She took the vials of holy water and antitoxin, leaving the holy symbol, rope, wooden stake and spyglass inside.

Marcus reviewed the scrolls that were found, spells that would come in handy written down for them. One would help in removing curses, the other to  create great illusions.

Aeli unfurled the map that was inside the parchment sleeve. Another map of Barovia, but this one was different. This map was touched by magic that marked areas of the map in different colours that glowed and shimmered faintly. A blue marker in Vallaki, a green marker over where they stood, large red markers over  the Amber Temple and three other locations - but what did these colours mean.

Not wanting to waste anymore time, they set off for Argnvostholt, Aeli watched the green marker on the map move as they did towards their destination.

A sparkle on the side of the road caught Aeli's attention. She stopped the cart to see what had been left, perhaps another clue. As she picked it up and cleared away the dirt and debris, the picture frame she held in her hands cut deep into her soul. It was picture she had drawn for her brother on his 10th birthday. She was no artist, but her brother did truly treasure the image of he and Aeli holding hands as loving family do.

Aeli shed a quick tear but eyes darted around looking for any sign of who had placed this painful reminder on the side of the road. Unable to find anything she hopped back into the drivers seat with her picture and continued on.

High above the river valley the sepulchral mansion loomed, its turrets capped with fairytale cones, its towers lined with sculpted battlements. They could see that a third of the structure has collapsed, as had part of the roof, but the rest appeared intact. A dark, octagonal tower rose above the surrounding architecture.

In the courtyard entrance to the Argynvostholt, perched atop a ten-foot-wide, ten-foot-high cube of granite, a moss-covered statue of a dragon stood facing the mansion, its wings tucked close to its body. 

Aeli, Marcus and Lars stepped out while Kasimir and Ireena offered to stay behind and guard their wagon.

The trio climbed the flagstone steps flanked by stone railings to a landing in front of a pair of tall, wooden doors with rusted iron bands and knockers shaped like small dragons. Marcus spotted the word Argynvostholt carved into the lintel above the entrance, confirming they arrived where they meant to.

Suddenly the dragon statue opened its mouth and exhaled at the visitors, thankfully it was only harmless cold air.

The front doors opened with ease as Marcus conjured an arcane hand to assist. The foyer felt like a king’s tomb. A grand staircase led up to stone balconies held aloft by stone pillars and arches. A tall, faded tapestry depicting a nobleman in silver armor hung from an iron rod above the staircase landing. Two chandeliers of wrought iron hang from the ceiling like monstrous black spiders.

As they stepped inside, a great shadow with wings moved across the walls and disappears while the sound of a soft bestial hiss called out from the darkness.

Along the walls, displayed on marble pedestals, were three alabaster busts of handsome men. A fourth bust and its pedestal had been knocked over, and their shattered remains lie strewn across the mosaic floor. Aeli inspected the smashed bust, putting the pieces together and could not comprehend that it bore an unsettling resemblance to Lars. Even Lars thoughts the similarity was uncanny.

The placard had that name Ser Sergei von Zarovich engraved into it, but scratch marks showed that someone had tried to remove the name. The other busts were of other knights of the order, Ser Seraz Drakov, Ser Vladimir Horngaard, and Ser Elyndor Greaves.

They continued their expedition of the manor, hoping to find more answers.

They entered a vast chamber, rubble strewn throughout caused by the partial collapse of the rooms above it. On the pink marble floor, fallen chandeliers lay amid broken chairs and other furnishings. Thick webs stretch from wall to wall, and moving among them were too many giant spiders to count!

The spider attacked, crawling along the walls and spitting their web at the intruders. Aeli, Lars and Marcus fought back, defeating each of the overgrown arachnids.

What else could this place have in store for them?

#### Session notes

Lars sat apart from the group, his shoulders hunched, the swatch of fabric still clutched in his trembling hand. The fire that had driven his blows moments ago was gone, replaced by a heavy sadness that seemed to dim the world around him. Aeli and Marcus exchanged a glance, concern etched on their faces. This was not the first time Lars’s emotions had roiled beneath the surface, but this was different—raw, unguarded.

“I know this fabric,” Lars murmured, his voice strained. “It’s from the dress my sister, Sigrit, wore the day she was taken.”

The weight of his words settled over the group. Aeli’s brow furrowed. “But why? Why bring her to Barovia? To lure you here?” She hesitated, glancing at Marcus. “What do they want with you, Lars? What significance do you hold?”

Lars’s gaze hardened, his grief twisting into suspicion as his eyes settled on Kasimir. “And what of you?” he said, his voice sharp as a blade. “You, who lived among the Vistani—those who serve Strahd. How can we trust you?”

Kasimir’s expression darkened, but he did not shy away from the accusation. “My allegiance to the Vistani was never to Strahd,” he replied, his voice steady, though a hint of old pain lingered there. “Velikov, the man who took me in after Strahd’s armies left me for dead, was my only allegiance. He offered me a home, a family.”

His words hung in the air like the lingering mist of Barovia. “Velikov is long dead,” Kasimir continued, his voice softer now. “But I stayed among his descendants, hiding my hatred for Strahd, biding my time. My sister’s soul is trapped in Castle Ravenloft, and for her, I would see Strahd undone.”

The tension in the air eased, though Lars’s suspicion lingered like the embers of a dying fire. The group turned their attention forward, to the road ahead. The path to Argynvostholt awaited, but Barovia’s shadows were ever watchful.

Inside Ezmerelda’s wagon, Marcus and Aeli searched for anything that could aid them. The wooden trunk bore claw marks, but within lay weapons touched by magic. They claimed a longsword, a hand axe, a club, a longbow with a quiver of arrows, and a mace, leaving behind a dagger and crossbow. The wardrobe yielded a feathered cloak and gloves made of mismatched hides, but the fine clothing and short sword were left untouched.

A small wooden box caught their eye. As Aeli opened it, she drew a sharp breath. Within was a tarokka deck, the same kind used by Madam Eva to reveal their fortunes. Its presence here was no accident.

In the larger chest, Aeli found vials of holy water and antitoxin, though she left behind a holy symbol, a rope, a wooden stake, and a spyglass. Each item felt charged with purpose, but time pressed them forward.

Marcus examined two scrolls, their magic potent and carefully penned. One would lift curses; the other could weave illusions of astonishing scale.

Aeli unfurled a map from a parchment sleeve, her eyes widening as she studied it. Unlike any map they’d seen, this one glowed faintly, its markings alive with magic. A green light shone where they stood. Blue marked Vallaki. Red markers loomed ominously over the Amber Temple and three other sites. But the purpose of these colors remained a mystery.

Not wanting to waste anymore time, they set off for Argnvostholt, Aeli watched the green marker on the map move as they did towards their destination.

Aeli’s attention was caught by a sparkle at the roadside. She stopped the wagon and stepped into the mist. Buried in the dirt was a picture frame, its edges worn but intact. Her breath hitched as she cleared away the debris. Within the frame was a crude but heartfelt drawing—one she had made for her brother on his tenth birthday. Two figures stood hand in hand, smiling as only siblings could. A single tear escaped her eye before she hardened herself once more. Whoever had placed it there wanted her to find it. But why?

Unable to find any sign of who had left the painful reminder, Aeli returned to the driver’s seat. The picture rested in her lap as the wagon rolled forward.

High above the river valley, Argynvostholt loomed. Its turrets rose like fairytale spires, defiant against the encroaching gloom. The mansion was battered but not broken—its roof partially caved, a third of its structure lost to time. Yet, it retained a grim majesty, its dark octagonal tower piercing the mist.

The group stared up at it in silence. Within those walls lay answers—or dangers. Perhaps both.

The air in the courtyard of Argynvostholt carried a chill more potent than Barovia's usual gloom, as if the very stones of the place remembered something they could not speak of. At its center stood a moss-covered statue of a dragon, weathered but imposing, perched atop a cube of granite. Its wings, tucked close to its body, gave it an aura of vigilance, a sentinel frozen in time. Aeli, Marcus, and Lars stepped down from the wagon as Kasimir and Ireena exchanged a quiet glance and offered to remain behind to guard their belongings.

The trio ascended the broad, flagstone steps flanked by stone railings. Above the double doors of dark, weathered wood, its iron bands streaked with rust, Marcus spotted a single word carved into the lintel: *Argynvostholt*. It confirmed they had arrived, though the oppressive air of the place felt more like a sentence than a destination.

As if to test their resolve, the dragon statue stirred—or seemed to. Its moss-covered mouth opened, releasing a frigid gust of air that swept over them. No harm came, but the breath felt like a warning, ancient and knowing.

The great wooden doors swung open without resistance as Marcus conjured his arcane hand. Inside, the manor's foyer stretched before them like a mausoleum to forgotten grandeur. A grand staircase curved upward, its stone balustrades still noble despite the passage of years. Above the landing hung a massive, faded tapestry depicting a man clad in gleaming silver armor, his expression proud yet haunted. Wrought-iron chandeliers dangled overhead, their spindly frames resembling monstrous spiders frozen mid-crawl. The air was still, but not silent—it seemed to hum with a tension that hinted at the unseen.

Then came the shadow. Winged and enormous, it moved along the walls as if watching, assessing. It vanished as quickly as it appeared, but its low, hissing growl lingered, soft and bestial, from somewhere beyond the dim light.

The walls bore pedestals, three of which displayed alabaster busts of knights whose features, though timeworn, were undeniably noble. A fourth pedestal lay shattered, its remains strewn across the mosaic floor like the remnants of a forgotten tragedy. Aeli knelt by the pieces, fitting them together with care, her brow furrowed. When the face came into focus, her breath caught. The resemblance to Lars was undeniable, and even Lars himself stared at the fragments in stunned silence.

"Ser Sergei von Zarovich," Aeli read aloud from the damaged placard, the name etched deep yet clawed at by hands that had sought to erase it.

The other knights, their busts still intact, bore names that spoke of glory lost to time: Ser Seraz Drakov, Ser Vladimir Horngaard, and Ser Elyndor Greaves. The room seemed heavy with echoes of vows long broken.

But this was no time to linger. The group pressed forward, their boots clicking against the pink marble floor of a vast chamber. Rubble from above choked the space, chandeliers lay like broken skeletons among the debris, and thick webs hung from every corner, swaying faintly as if stirred by unseen movement. Then they saw them—spiders, their bloated forms shifting through the shadows, too numerous to count.

The creatures attacked with feral precision, crawling along walls and spitting threads of webbing that sought to ensnare the intruders. Aeli, Marcus, and Lars fought back with everything they had, their blades slicing through webs and chitin alike. Magic flared as Marcus unleashed arcane energy that shattered the nearest arachnid, while Lars’ blows struck true. Aeli’s sword found its mark again and again, her strikes guided by a determination that burned brighter than her fear.

When the last spider fell, silence returned, save for the trio’s ragged breathing. They stood among the carnage, their weapons dripping with ichor, and glanced at each other. The manor still loomed around them, oppressive and inscrutable, its secrets waiting in the shadows.





#### Kasimir
- his sister, Patrina Velikovna, is sealed in the catacombs below Castle Ravenloft. 
- Convinced that she was the concubine of the devil Strahd, Kasimir and his fellow dusk elves stoned Patrina to death. 
- As punishment for depriving him of his bride, Strahd butchered all the women in the dusk elf tribe, and Kasimir’s ears were cut off to punish him for instigating the stoning. 
	- He wears a cowl to conceal his mutilation.

- Kasimir’s feeling of loss is tinged with simmering rage. 
- Patrina now speaks to her brother in dreams, telling him how years of guilt and regret have dispelled all evil thoughts from her mind and cleansed her tortured soul. 
- But Kasimir remains unconvinced by her assertions, because he knows that Strahd has corrupted Patrina and led her down a path of evil and deceit. 
- For that reason, Kasimir wants to see the vampire destroyed so that his sister can be rescued from her eternal damnation.

##### Secrets of the Amber Temple
- Patrina has told Kasimir that the Amber Temple, an ancient vault hidden in the Barovian mountains, is where Strahd forged his pact with evil powers and discovered how to become a vampire. 
- Kasimir has been spying on the temple for years, but he needs adventurers to help him survive its perils. 
- He thinks that the secret to breaking Strahd’s pact and freeing Barovia from its curse might be hidden there, but more important, he believes that the Amber Temple holds the secret to bringing the ancient dead back to life.
- With the characters’ help, Kasimir thinks he might be able to find out how to restore Patrina to flesh and blood, whereupon he can travel to Castle Ravenloft and end his sister’s torment. 
- Kasimir has no inkling that Patrina is using him for exactly that purpose, and that her ultimate goal is to become as powerful a vampire as Strahd.
