## Session Overview 

After defeating [[Doru]], the group were quick to learn more  about the creature and it's lair. [[Lars]] focusing in on [[Doru]]'s body was drawn to the beast like claws and fangs. [[Marcus]] investigated the walls and doors, comforted by the fact that there was no way [[Doru]] was getting out anytime soon based on his current progress.

The party went back upstairs with Doru's lifeless body, [[Donavich|Father Donavich]] immediately broke down  and was taken over by grief as he learned that they had killed his son. [[Vidar]] refused to hand over the body, explaining that it was best for the town if they destroy it, threatening [[Donavich]] with harm if he stood in the way.

A fight in the holy building broke out, during which [[Lars]] made a hasty exit out of the church. Enraged by his party's abondment, [[Vidar]] tried to strike [[Lars]] but missed. Attempting to difuse the situation, [[Marcus]] levitated [[Vidar]] away from danger and dragged him outside to let [[Donavich]] mourn over his son.

[[Vidar]] ran off after exclaiming his disgust at [[Lars]] for leaving him during the fight, at [[Marcus]] making him an easy target and at [[Sorrow]] for just hiding in the corner.

The party converse with a concerned [[Ismark Kol­yanovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]], the Barovians suggest that the group rest a couple of days to ready themselves for the difficult path that awaits them - but not for too long because they are not safe from [[Strahd von Zarovich]] in the village.

[[Ireena Kolyana]] runs off after [[Lars]] insinuates that she must be in love with [[Strahd von Zarovich]] , [[Aeli]] and [[Sorrow]] run after her. To explain why, [[Ismark Kol­yanovich]] reveals that [[Strahd von Zarovich]] referred to [[Ireena Kolyana]] as his "beloved" when he attacked and bit her.

At the [[Blood of the Vine Tavern]], [[Lars]] sits down to some wine while [[Marcus]] searches for [[Vidar]], entering the room they slept in the night to spot ravens awaiting at the open window and fly off as soon as he enters.

Continuing his search, he finds a room where a child answers, claiming not to know who [[Vidar]] even is. [[Marcus]] heads back to the common room to enjoy some wine and conversation with [[Lars]], already a few wines deep. [[Arik]] the bartender, overhears their conversation and asks if they are the [[Mad Mage]] from the lake and the pair engage in a friendly game of identity switch.

At the Burgomaster's mansion, [[Aeli]] and [[Sorrow]] comfort [[Ireena Kolyana]] who mourns her father and laments that he is not their to guide her. [[Sorrow]] heads out to look for the others while [[Aeli]] inspects the mansion's defences to ensure they are safe from any further attacks.

On her way through town, [[Sorrow]] notices that some ravens are circling above, almost as if keeping an eye on her every move, she quickly takes aim with her crossbow but misses, causing the birds to fly off.

She also observes the old lady selling her Dream Pastries house to house, despite the warnings from the group to leave the town.

Once inside the tavern she questions the gents about [[Vidar]], and joins them as they look for him. [[Marcus]] guides them to the room with the child and picks the lock, but a door underneath the handle still prevents their entry. [[Lars]] and [[Marcus]] go back to drinking while [[Sorrow]] tries to check through the window from the outside.

At the mansion, [[Ireena Kolyana]] asks [[Aeli]] about where she learned to use the sword, finding comfort in their shared experience of living in the shadow of their brother. [[Ireena Kolyana]] also asks about [[Aeli]]'s love life, sharing her thoughts of a life without love is not yet lived. She shares with [[Aeli]] that her soul yearns for it's other half, a search her father has prevented her from for many years.

[[Sorrow]] peers through the window of the tavern room, seeing that although someone had recently been in there, there was no sign of anyone now. She joins [[Lars]] and [[Marcus]] in the bar and enjoys some libations and food, not caring about the townsfolk who enter the tavern, stopping their drinking to blankly stare at the foreigners from time to time. 

[[Sorrow]] departs the tavern and heads back to meet up with [[Aeli]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]]. 

Night falls over [[Barovia]] and the they have an uninterrupted and well earned sleep.

The next morning, [[Vidar]] meets with [[Aeli]], [[Sorrow]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]] out the front of the burgomaster's residence and exclaims that he no longer trusts his companions and is wanting to leave the village immediately. They head off, and are joined by [[Lars]] and [[Marcus]] who had left the tavern after securing two bottles of Purple Grapemash No. 3, the label confirming it was grown, fermented and bottled at the [[Wizard of Wines Winery]].

The attempts to amend relationships are fruitless, but they put the animosity aside and all head off on their journey. A few hours out of the village, they cross an arching stone bridge over the 50 foot wide river.

As the midday sun looms high in the sky, they arrive at an old wooden gallows that creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: the [[Village of Barovia|Barovia Village]] to the east, [[Tser Pool]] to the northwest, and [[Ravenloft]]/[[Vallaki]] to the southwest. The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog.

A creaking noise draws their attention back to the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon the adventurers who each recognise the person staring at them. 

[[Aeli]] sees her brother Elian.
[[Vidar]] see his older brother.
[[Lars]] sees Sigrit, his sister.
[[Sorrow]] see the woman who raised her, Tianna.
[[Marcus]] however only sees a random Barovian.

[[Lars]] rushes to the body and cuts the body down, crying over his sister's body and becoming even more distraught as it melts away into nothing.

[[Ireena Kolyana]] warns them that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is a cruel being, who will use every trick to manipulate and assert his dominance over all of [[Barovia]].  They too must have caught his attention somehow, so they must remain vigilant.

Ravens circle above the group as they press on, [[Sorrow]] cautious about them being spies implores [[Lars]] to shoot them with his longbow even though [[Ireena Kolyana]] explains that ravens are not controlled by [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. [[Lars]] begrudgingly obliges his friends request and hits one of the birds above and they scatter.

As the sun sets, the road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.

The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.

The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest’s edge.

Lingering on the outskirts of the town, the party  overhears one of the Vistani recounting the following tale:

> [!quote]
> A mighty wizard came to this land over a year ago. I remember him like it was yesterday. He stood exactly where you’re standing. A very charismatic man, he was. He thought he could rally the people of [[Barovia]] against the devil Strahd. He stirred them with thoughts of revolt and bore them to the castle en masse. “When the vampire appeared, the wizard’s peasant army fled in terror. A few stood their ground and were never seen again.
> 
> “The wizard and the vampire cast spells at each other. Their battle flew from the courtyards of Ravenloft to a precipice overlooking the falls. I saw the battle with my own eyes. Thunder shook the mountainside, and great rocks tumbled down upon the wizard, yet by his magic he survived. Lightning from the heavens struck the wizard, and again he stood his ground. But when the devil Strahd fell upon him, the wizard’s magic couldn’t save him. I saw him thrown a thousand feet to his death. I climbed down to the river to search for the wizard’s body, to see if, you know, he had anything of value, but the River Ivlis had already spirited him away.”

The Vistani leader Dorgus, welcomes them to the camp and to share their fire for the evening. [[Sorrow]] heads to [[Madam Eva]]'s tent, where magic flames cast a reddish glow over the interior, revealing a low table covered in a black velvet cloth. Glints of light seem to flash from a crystal ball on the table as a hunched figure peers into its depths. As the crone speaks, her voice crackles like dry weeds. “At last you have arrived!” Cackling laughter bursts like mad lightning from her withered lips. 

[[Madam Eva]] proves her abilities, revealing information she should not yet know, and asks about [[Sorrow]]'s companions. [[Aeli]], [[Vidar]] and [[Lars]] follow [[Sorrow]] into the Fortune Teller's tent. [[Madam Eva]] again proves her talents, asking about their time in the Durst House and the fight with the shambling mound.

She offers a reading of their fortune, produces a worn deck of cards, shuffles and draws five cards, placing them on the table.

She proceeds to flip the cards one by one to reveal information to help them on the path that lies ahead.

Not yet convinced, Vidar's questions [[Madam Eva]] who reveals that Ruic is [[Vidar]]'s birth father, but left when he realised that staying would only cause suffering for and hardship for his son.

[[Madam Eva]] also reveals that [[Rose and Thorn]] still inhabit the bodies of [[Vidar]] and [[Sorrow]], confirming that there is a way to remove the ghosts of the dead children before their control grows.

The party all exit, but [[Lars]] stays back to ask about his love life, (with [[Aeli]] and [[Sorrow]] hiding close by to eavesdrop). [[Madam Eva]] shares that he will find love, but if she were to reveal it then he would not appreciate the connection when he found it and the love would not bloom.

[[Madam Eva]] requets [[Lars]] to keep an eye on [[Marcus]], explaining that he has a darkness over him and a power that can make him dangerous to their goals. If the time comes, [[Lars]] must make the tough choice to save [[Barovia]] over his friend.

As [[Aeli]] and [[Sorrow]] sneak back to the fire, they trip over a tent line revealing their presence, and are forced to kiss in front of the entire camp to try and hide what they were doing.
