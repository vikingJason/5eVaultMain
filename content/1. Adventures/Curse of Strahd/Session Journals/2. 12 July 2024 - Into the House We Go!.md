Lars and Sorrow enter the house, finding themselves in the Main Hall. Looking around for threats, they find nothing but dust, some closed doors, a large spiral stair case and a Longsword hanging on the wall above the fireplace. The rest of the party join them inside and everyone fans out to explore, heading to one of the closed doors. All except Marcus, who stands in the main hall, equidistant to all and taking notes. A cool breeze blows from the fireplace against his neck, sending a chill down his spine.
 
Sorrow opens the door to what can only be described as a Hunter's Den. A stags head mounted over the fireplace, three stuffed wolves positioned around the room to show off a successful hunt. The table and chairs covered in different furs. Sorrow attempts to break into one of the two cupboards in the room, but the rusty lock proves too difficult for the thief's skills with a lock pick.
 
Vidar notices that the main hall is covered in dust, yet there are no signs of any footsteps besides the ones the group have now just made.
 
Vidar calls out to Lars, who has attempt to sneak up the staircase. His attempt to remain unnoticed did not provided the preferred results, with the third step giving way and breaking with a loud snap under the weight of his foot.
 
Lars ascends to the top of the stair case, hears Vidar's warning and makes his way silently back down the stairs until the weight of his step breaks yet another step.
 
Aeli presses her ears to the door she is standing in front of, certain she hears the faint sound of something scraping against the door.
 
Vidar opens the door to an immaculately clean dining room. The room furnished with a beautifully crafted mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is covered with resplendent silverware and crystalware polished to a dazzling shine, a stark contrast to the condition of the main hall.
 
Upon spotting the stuffed wolves as he comes downstairs, Lars, not taking any chances makes haste in attacking the potential threats.
 
Back in the dining room, the party is sure that the wolf being hunted by an aristocratic hunting party depicted in a tapestry hanging on the wall changes color.
 
Vidar and Sorrow enter a kitchen, seeing a well kept work area. Vidar finds a pantry with fresh looking food staples, fruits and vegetables, salt, flour etc.
 
Sorrow discovers a dumb waiter in good working order. Unsure and untrusting, Vidar throws an apple from the pantry in the dumb waiter and sends it upstairs, eager to learn more about what surprises the house may have in store for them.
 
The adventurers head up to the second story of the house, a dark hall illuminated by Vidars holy light shining by the grace of Tymora. A large portrait of a wealthy family is spotlighted, a father holding a baby, a mother and two children - who look like the children that warned the group about the monster inside the house.
 
There are four suits of armor on display, each clutching spears and sporting visors shaped like wolf's heads.
 
Lars notices that there are unlit oil lamps hanging upon the wall and lights one. Immediately a cool wind blows from downstairs and snuffs the flame. Lars attempts a second and third time, with each attempt the breeze intensifying as it counters Lars' efforts.
 
The two doors that to lead out of the upper hall are carved with dancing youths, although as Sorrow inspects the door closer for any potental traps she notices that from the right angles, the youths aren’t really dancing but fighting off swarms of bats.
 
Sorrow enters a library and is greeted by floor to ceiling shelves stacjed with books and an exquisite mahogany desk with a matching high-back chair.
 
Sights set on the desk, Sorrow searches and finds an oil lamp, a jar of ink, a quill pen, a tinderbox, and a letter kit containing a red wax candle, four blank sheets of parchment, and a wooden seal bearing a family’s insignia (a windmill). The desk drawer provides an interesting discovery, an iron key.
 
Lars enters a large elegant room, with a harpsichord and harp identifying this room is used to entertain. Lars takes an opportunity to look out the windows and notices that the mist that has been following them, has completely engulfed the village making it impossible to see any other dwelling.
 
Sorrow continues to search the library, disturbing a fragile bookshelf as she does which uncovers a hidden door.
 
As they enter the secret room they uncover bookshelves packed with tomes, a little different than the books in the library. The attention of the books is brief as the party spot a large chest partially open with a skeleton sticking out.
 
The adventurers notice three darts sticking out of the skeleton and a letter in it's grip.

Sorrow exercises caution as she carefully retrieve the contents of the chest: • three blank books with black leather covers • three spell scrolls (bless, protection from poison, and spiritual weapon) • the deed to the house • the deed to a windmill • a will signed by Gustav and Elisabeth Durst and bequeathes the house, the windmill, and all other family property to Rosavalda and Thornboldt Durst in the event of their parents’ deaths.
 
Marcus tries to unpack the inner workings of Lars' pysche after observing his interesting behaviour. Lars reveals that his family went missing not too long ago, the only clues he has are the footprints of some sort of beast and a bloodied sickle.
 
Unable to stay in the same spot any longer, the pair head up to the third level of the house to a dusty balcony with a suit of black plate armor standing against one wall, draped in cobwebs.
 
As they move into the room to keep their expedition going, the armor animates and attacks.

Aeli, Vidar and Sorrow soon hear the commotion and rush upstairs to assist, shortly thereafter the armor crumbles to the floor defeated.
 
The search of the house continues, with Vidar and Sorrow locating the master bedroom. Vidar finds the dumbwaiter with an apple waiting for him while Sorrow pilfers a jewelry box made of silver with gold filigree containing three gold rings and a thin platinum necklace with a topaz pendant.
 
Lars' good nature gets the best of him and he expresses his displeasure of Sorrow's actions.
 
Aeli, waiting patiently for the others presses her ear to a door, on the other side the sound of something sweeping across the floor is heard. She opens the door that leads to a storage room with folded sheets, blankets and cobweb covered broom.
 
She shuts the door and accompanies Lars to investigate a nursery while Marcus waits in the hall.
 
This drab and dreary room holds nothing of interest besides dust covered furniture, double doors set with panes of stained glass leading to an outside balcony and another door connecting to an adjoining room.
 
Lars investigates the adjoining room, seeing a corporeal figure staring back at him. A skeletally thin young woman, with a terrified look on her face. Lars tried to communicate with the creature.
 
It responds by showing it's true hideous and ferocious form, and then attacking.

 The party deliver blow after blow to the creature who seemed to resist their attacks, until finally it is defeated. But at what cost? Poor Lars received a nasty attack that has drained his life force.
