## Session Overview 


Standing watch and seeing the commotion at the top of the hill, Lars joins the Sorrow, Aeli and Vidar as Marcus slips away to keep lookout.

Void of any means to restore Vidar's health, they stabilise the cleric and head into the tent to continue their search.

Searching hi and low confirms that the bones are not in the tent. Aeli unties the badly beaten Milivoj and probes him for the information they need to locate the Bones of St Andral. Milivoj's responses lead Aeli to believe that he needs some time to recover from his imprisonment before he can be of further use.

Lars stands guard over Vidar inside the tent, waiting with Milivoj and trying to remember how Dragomir used to create the restorative tinctures back home. Aeli and Sorrow begin their systematic search of the Vistani wagons surrounding the tent. Aeli begins her search with a large barrel-topped wagon with two iron padlocks that secure the door.

Their search is interrupted when Lars notices that Milivoj has started to flee and raises the alarm. Sorrow quickly subdues the gravedigger and returns him to the tent. To keep their only lead, Lars hog ties Milivoj and suspends him from the support beam in the tent mere inches from the ground.

Continuing their search, Aeli and Sorrow find nothing of note in the homely wagons and return to the locked carriage. An exhausted Sorrow tries to pick the locks, proving too much for her skills she jams the mechanism. Aeli uses her crowbar and leverages all of her strength to try and pry it open. The doors groan under the weight of the immense pressure and burst open, triggering some poisoned needles to pop out and stab Aeli.

Looking inside, Aeli and Sorrow realise that they may have hit the jackpot. The wagon is filled with treasures:
- A wooden chest containing
- An iron chest
- An onyx jewellery box with gold filigree
- A wooden throne with gold inlay and decorative stones
- A rolled-up 10-foot-square rug
- A small wooden box containing

Hoping to find the holy relic, Sorrow opens the small wooden box, finding twelve potions in stoppered gourds.

With the rain pelting down and the hour growing late, the adventurers decide to commandeer some horses and the wagon to head back to the Inn for the evening.

---

The guards at the gates halt the party as they approach, stating that no one in or out after dark. Lars convinces him that they are members of the guard, having recently taken the oath and that they have Lady Wachter in the back, making use of the unconscious Vidar who has not yet reverted back from his disguise. Believing it is the fugitive in the back of the wagon, the guard quickly opens the gates, ushering them in quickly to take the prisoner to the Baron immediately.

They lead the cart to the Blue Water Inn and are greeted by Kasimir, who had been waiting outside the front door to the tavern frantically for the group to arrive.

Danica greets the weary visitors as they enter, spotting a restrained Milivoj and knowing the situation is dire, she agrees to put the grave digger in the attic so that he can not escape.

Lars takes Vidar up to his room, stopping briefly to acknowledge the hospitality of Danica. Spotting Ireena asleep in one of the beds, Lars carefully lays Vidar down next to her and makes himself comfortable to  in their room,  

Moments later, Lars is rustled awake as Ireena slips into his bed. He fends off her advances, sharing more about his hometown as Ireena drifts back to sleep, then Lars takes the opportunity to slither out of the bed and sleep on the floor.

---

Wasting no time, Sorrow heads to the church to obtain the assistance of Father Lucian. The strong sense of urgency brings her to dismiss Kasimir, resulting in the Dusk Elf turning and walking off dejected.

At the church, the doors are locked. Despite the incessant pounding from Sorrow, there is no answer from the other side. Not wanting to be admit defeat, she heads around to the back entrance, and picks the locks on the holy building. Sorrow finds Father Lucian and he absconds her for breaking in. Sorrow implores the priest for assistance, but he refuses saying that he can not leave the church at night without the bones protecting it but gives her some tea for her companion.

After Father Lucian agrees to find them at first light, Sorrow apologies and leaves for the tavern. Not far from her destination, she spots a swarm of bats circling in the sky above the wagon filled with Vistani treasure. She cautiously opens the wagon doors and begins to move the treasures inside. Suddenly the bats let out a ear bursting screech and fly away, heading east.

Aeli and Sorrow, with the assistance of Urwin, haul all of the items from the wagon into their room and begin to inspect what they have found.

Inside the wooden chest, they find 1,200 ep, each coin stamped with the profiled visage of Strahd.
The iron chest containing 650 gp.
Within the jewellery box is six pieces of cheap jewellery and a potion in an unlabelled crystal vial.
The rug, when unrolled revealed only an exquisite unicorn motif .
The wooden throne revealing no secrets.

An impressive score, but no bones.

Danica brews the special tea for Vidar, bringing it up to the guests room. Lars assists with propping open Vidar's mouth so Danica can pour it down his throat. The refreshing brew restores some of his stamina and vitality, but they are in still in need of a good night's rest.

---

In the morning, Father Lucian arrives as agreed. The party converge in the common room and Milivoj is brought down for questioning.

Vidar's warnings, sounding almost as thinly veiled threats, soon draw out answers from Milivoj. The young man breaks down, confessing that he was sorry and didn't know anything about the bones being a sacred relic.

Vidar scales up his interrogation. Milivoj shares that all he remembers is that after handing in the bones and receiving his payment, he kept a low profile while he made some preparations, but was ambushed near his home and awoke to the beating from the Vistani.

Unsatisfied that they had not learned anything new, the interrogation intensified until a small detail stood out. Milivoj claimed that he returned the bones to his benefactor at their store, not at the Wachterhaus. Milivoj revealed that it was not Lady Wachter, but Henrik van der Voort the coffin maker, who had paid him to steal the bones.

With the new lead, they hurried towards the Coffin Maker's Shop.

The uninviting shop, two stories tall, has a sign shaped like a coffin above the front door. All of the window shutters closed up tight, and a deathly silence surrounds the establishment.

They loudly knock on the door, demanding to be let inside but the weathered voice on the other side implored them to leave him alone. Finding no other way in, Aeli and Lars take to the strong door with their axes, breaking it down so they can get what they came for.

The mediocre carpenter puts up no resistance as they storm in, demanding answers. He shares that one night several months ago, he was visited by an imposing, well-dressed nobleman named Vasili von Holtz and promised the coffin maker “good business” in exchange for his help. 

The agreement was not exactly the coffin maker thought it would be, instead of finding fortune, he  has taken advantage of, forced to do von Holtz's bidding through fear and intimidation. Henrik goes on to share that it was von Holtz that requested for the bones to be acquired.

Henrik concedes that the bones are currently being stored upstairs until they are called for by his new business partner. Aeli races straight up to retrieve them as quickly as possible.

Vidar already clued in, continues to talk down the coffin maker. He reveals that Vasili von Holtz is an alias used by Strahd, trying to help Henrik see the error of his ways. Henrik however is not phased to learn this, he already knows that it was Strahd. The coffin maker tells them that it didn't take long for his workshop to become the lair of a pack of vampire spawn.

Alarmed, Vidar calls back Aeli from her solitary search upstairs. They cautiously move together as a group up the narrow stairway. Vidar calls forth a divine blessing on his companions before Aeli opens the door to a large, drafty room, strung with cobwebs. Aeli silently moves deeper into this room that takes up most of the upper floor.

Sorrow follows closely behind, but her foot bumps one of the stacks of wooden planks that lie amid the room, bringing it crashing down. Taking a moment to see if anything was roused by the clamour, they continue their cautious search, finding only more stacks of wood and several crates marked “JUNK.”

Sorrow climbs onto one the crates to try and open a window, and seeing that it would be near impossible climbs back down.

As her foot touches the floor, a creatures bursts from inside the crate, its skin is pale and sickly and its eyes glow with an unnatural light. Its movements are jerky, like a puppet with loose strings but still lethal. It claws at Sorrow, clutching her tightly as it does. It opens it's mouth, showcasing it's long fangs before sinking them into Sorrow's flesh and draining her.

It licks its lips as Sorrow's body falls to the floor.





The night was thick with the smell of rain-soaked earth and the tang of old wood, the air weighted with tension as Lars stood sentinel at the hill’s crest. Below, the flicker of lanterns marked where Sorrow, Aeli, and Vidar moved through the darkness, their task pressing and perilous. Marcus, shadow-bound and watchful, melted into the gloom to keep an eye on their flanks.

Vidar lay pale and still, his strength sapped by the encounter earlier that day. With no means to mend his wounds, the group made do with stabilizing him before turning their attention back to the task at hand: finding the sacred Bones of St. Andral. The tent, a canvas fortress stained with years of weather and time, offered no solace. Aeli’s keen eyes scoured every corner and crevice, but the search yielded little. Outside, the rain began to fall in earnest, a curtain of silver whispering against the tents and wagons of the Vistani encampment.

Within the tent, Milivoj, the gravedigger, slumped in a heap, bruised and weary from his captivity. Aeli’s voice, sharp as a dagger, probed for answers, but the man’s resolve was weakened by his ordeal. His words came haltingly, offering more frustration than clarity. He would need rest before he could provide the guidance they sought, and Lars, though reluctant, stood guard over the man, his mind adrift on memories of home and the tinctures his mentor, Dragomir, had once brewed with ease.

Sorrow and Aeli moved among the wagons like shadows, each step cautious, each motion deliberate. The Vistani wagons were as colorful as they were enigmatic, their contents hidden behind sturdy locks and stout wood. One, in particular, drew Aeli’s focus—a barrel-topped wagon with iron padlocks securing its secrets. Sorrow’s fingers danced over the locks, seeking to undo their mysteries, but the mechanisms proved too complex. 



Frustration etched her brow as she jammed the mechanism entirely. It was then that Aeli, her patience at its end, took up her crowbar. With a groan that echoed through the camp, the door burst open, a spray of poisoned needles lashing out in defense. Aeli gasped as the sting of the trap bit into her skin.

Inside the wagon, the flickering lantern light revealed a hoard of treasures: gilded chests, an onyx jewelry box inlaid with gold filigree, a rolled-up rug bearing an exquisite unicorn motif, and even a wooden throne. Hopeful, Sorrow pried open a small box to find twelve potions, their contents sloshing within stoppered gourds. Yet, for all their searching, the sacred relic eluded them still.

The rain intensified as the group commandeered horses and the treasure-laden wagon, their path winding back to the village’s gates. There, guards barred their passage, their stern faces illuminated by the torchlight. Lars, quick-witted and persuasive, spun a tale of oaths sworn to the Baron and a fugitive captured. Vidar, still unconscious and disguised as Lady Wachter, lent credence to the ruse. The gates creaked open, and the group slipped through, ushered towards their supposed audience with the Baron. Instead, they made for the Blue Water Inn.

Kasimir, pale with worry, awaited them at the inn’s threshold. Within, Danica’s eyes widened at the sight of the battered Milivoj. Without hesitation, she agreed to confine him in the attic. Upstairs, Lars laid Vidar beside a sleeping Ireena, whose presence seemed to draw a fleeting smile from the stoic warrior. The night wore on, and as Lars resisted Ireena’s gentle advances, he found solace on the hard floor, his mind restless and weary.

Sorrow, unwilling to wait for dawn, sought the aid of Father Lucian at the church. Her pounding on the doors echoed in the quiet streets, but no answer came. She circled to the back and deftly picked the lock, slipping inside to find the priest. His rebuke was swift but tempered by the urgency of her plea. Yet, he would not leave the sanctuary of the church without the protection of the bones. With a sigh of defeat, he handed her a restorative tea for her companion and promised to come at first light.

Returning to the inn, Sorrow’s sharp eyes caught the ominous swirl of bats above the Vistani wagon. Their screeches sent shivers down her spine as she hurried to secure the treasures inside. As the bats fled eastward, her unease deepened.

Morning broke, and the party reconvened in the inn’s common room. Father Lucian arrived as promised, and Milivoj, his bindings still taut, was brought down. Vidar’s questions, laced with veiled menace, pried loose the truth. Milivoj spoke of his betrayal, of a transaction with Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, whose greed had led him to deal with forces far darker than he understood.

Their path led them to the coffin maker’s shop, a dour building with shutters sealed tight and silence hanging heavy. When Henrik refused them entry, their patience snapped. The door gave way beneath their axes, revealing a man broken by fear. Henrik’s tale was chilling—an encounter with Vasili von Holtz, whose promises of wealth masked the shadow of Strahd himself.

Upstairs, their search was interrupted by chaos. A crate burst open, and from within sprang a vampire spawn, its pale skin and gleaming fangs a harbinger of doom. It lunged at Sorrow, its claws rending flesh and its fangs drinking deep. As her body crumpled to the floor, the room filled with the coppery scent of blood, and the battle for their lives began.






The storm clawed at the hilltop, rain slashing sideways, drenching the ragged figures. Lars stood in the deluge, his hand resting on the hilt of his weapon, eyes narrowed against the gloom. The distant cries of the others reached him—a commotion. Without hesitation, he joined the fray, his steps deliberate, his presence steady as a lodestone. The hill seemed alive with tension, the wind carrying whispers of danger.

Marcus, shadow-bound and watchful, melted into the gloom to keep an eye on their flanks.

They gathered in the rain-drenched tent—Sorrow, Aeli, Lars, and Vidar, the latter's body crumpled and pale, his vitality drained from the earlier skirmish. They lacked the means to restore him, so they did the next best thing: stabilized him, a fragile thread of life tethering him to the here and now.

The search continued. The tent offered no answers, its hollow space mocking their urgency. Aeli's keen eyes turned to Milivoj, a beaten man bound by his captors. She questioned him, her voice a blend of authority and empathy, but his answers were slow to come, his spirit battered as much as his body. He needed time, Aeli decided. Time they might not have.

Lars, resolute as a mountain, stood guard. He glanced down at Vidar’s still form, a flicker of memory crossing his face—Dragomir, back home, concocting tinctures to mend broken bodies. That knowledge felt so close and yet so distant.

Aeli and Sorrow moved moved among the wagons like shadows, each step cautious, each motion deliberate, their search methodical but yielding little. Iron padlocks secured one carriage, its promise tantalizing. Their search was interrupted when Lars called out to his companions, alerting them that Milivoj was trying to flee. Sorrow pursued and quickly subdued the grave digger, trudging through the mud to return him to the tent. To keep their only lead, Lars hog tied Milivoj and suspended him from the support beam in the tent mere inches from the ground.

Sorrow and Aeli returned to the colourful yet enigmatic Vistani wagon with the contents hidden behind sturdy locks and stout wood. Sorrow’s tools faltered against the mechanisms, leaving them jammed. Frustration mounting, Aeli took her crowbar and, with a Herculean effort, forced the doors open. The satisfying _crack_ of wood splitting was a momentary triumph until poisoned needles lashed out, embedding themselves in Aeli’s arm.

Inside the wagon, the flickering lantern light revealed a hoard of treasures: gilded chests, an onyx jewelry box inlaid with gold filigree, a rolled-up rug bearing an exquisite unicorn motif, and even a wooden throne. Hopeful, Sorrow pried open a small box to find twelve potions, their contents sloshing within stoppered gourds. Yet, for all their searching, the sacred relic eluded them still.

The rain intensified as the group commandeered horses and the treasure-laden wagon, their path winding back to the village’s gates. 

As they approached the gates, the guards halted them. Lars, ever the pragmatist, wove a tale of oaths taken and prisoners captured. He motioned to Vidar, still cloaked in his disguise, claiming he was the fugitive Lady Wachter. The ruse worked, the gates swinging open, their entry hurried and unquestioned.

At the inn, Kasimir awaited them, his worry etched deep. Inside, Danica’s sharp eyes took in the scene, her lips tightening at the sight of Milivoj. Without hesitation, she agreed to confine him in the attic.

Exhaustion weighed heavy on them as they settled in. Lars carried Vidar upstairs, laying him beside Ireena. Her presence, warm and steady, seemed a balm. Later that night, when she slipped into his bed, Lars deflected her advances with a quiet patience, sharing instead fragments of his past until she drifted into sleep. He found his place on the floor, a sentinel even in slumber.

---

Sorrow, unwilling to wait for dawn, sought the aid of Father Lucian at the church. The strong sense of urgency clawing at her, distracting her with thoughts only on her friend and the task at hand. The unwelcome interruption from Kasimir trying to help proved too great a distraction, and she dismissed the Dusk Elf who turned and walked off into the night, dejected.

Sorrow's pounding on the doors echoed in the quiet streets, but no answer came. She circled to the back and deftly picked the lock, slipping inside to find the priest. His rebuke was swift but tempered by the urgency of her plea. Yet, he would not leave the church while it was without the protection of the bones. With a sigh of defeat, he handed Sorrow a restorative tea for her companion and promised to come at first light.

Returning to the inn, Sorrow’s sharp eyes caught the ominous swirl of bats above the Vistani wagon. Their screeches sent shivers down her spine as she hurried to secure the treasures inside. As the bats fled eastward, her unease deepened.

Morning arrived sluggishly, rain giving way to a cold mist. Father Lucian entered the inn, his expression grave. The interrogation of Milivoj resumed, Vidar’s calm words laced with veiled menace. The gravedigger crumbled, confessing his role in the theft of the bones. His story wove a thread toward a new lead—Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker.

They moved hurriedly through the streets of Vallaki, noticing that today was the day was to be a day of celebration and festivities - the Festival of Blazing Sun was going to start soon.

The Coffin Maker’s Shop loomed before them, an unwelcoming silhouette against the ashen sky. Their demands for entry met resistance. Lars and Aeli wasted no time, axes biting into the door until it yielded. Henrik, cowed and shaking, spilled his story—a tale of fear and coercion, of deals struck in desperation with a man named Vasili von Holtz who promised the coffin maker “good business” in exchange for his help.

The name sent ripples through the group, and when Henrik revealed that the Bones of St Andral were being stored upstairs, Aeli surged ahead. 

Vidar connected the dots, making a terrifying realisation. Trying to help Henrik see the error of his ways, Vidar revealed that Vasili was no mere man but an alias for Strahd himself. Henrik however was not phased upon hearing this, he had known for some time that it was Strahd, sharing  that it didn't take long for his workshop to become the lair of a pack of vampire spawn.

Alarmed, Vidar called out to Aeli to quickly end from her solitary search upstairs. They continue their search for the holy relic together, their movements deliberate as they ascended the narrow stairway.

The room above was a mausoleum of dust and decay, its silence oppressive. Sorrow’s misstep sent planks tumbling, the noise reverberating like a gong. When nothing stirred, they pressed on, finding only more stacks of wood and several crates marked “JUNK.”

Sorrow climbed onto one the crates to try and open a window to the outside world, and seeing that it would be near impossible climbed back down paying little attention to her surroundings—until the crate burst open.

A creature emerged with a feral snarl, its jerky movements inhuman. Pale, luminous eyes locked onto Sorrow as its claws tore into her. She cried out, a gurgle of pain as its fangs sank deep, draining her blood. The creature licked its lips, a grotesque mockery of satisfaction, and Sorrow’s body crumpled.

The others stood frozen for a heartbeat, calculating the best course of action, as the stakes rise and they faced this harbinger of doom.
