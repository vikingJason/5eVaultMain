## Session Overview 

Reeling after their fight with the werewolf,  Lars, Marcus and Aeli set up shifts to take watch as their make camp under the open night sky. Lars takes the first watch, keeping vigilant as his companions sleep and thankful nothing threatens their camp.

---

Vidar and Sorrow, knowing there is safety in numbers, share a room at the Blue Water Inn for the evening. They reinforce the door and secure the windows as best as possible, providing a sense of comfort that allows them to get some sleep.

---

Aeli's shift on watch starts uneventful, and just as she is certain that there will be nothing to report the sounds of a horse and cart travelling quickly along the road breaks the noise of the nocturnal forest creatures. Aeli quickly moves closer to Lars and Marcus, ready to wake them if needed, but she witnesses the cart move past without any indication that the campers had been spotted.

Relieved that they did not have another fight on their hands, Aeli wakes Marcus for his turn to keep look out. Marcus maintains a watchful eye, noticing that the noise of the forest had suddenly gone quiet. A cloud of bats immediately swarm above the campsite, circling overhead in the night sky before flying off just quickly in the direction of Vallaki.

---

Asleep in their bed at the Blue Water Inn, Sorrow and Vidar are roused awake by screaming and alarm bells ringing throughout the town. Hurrying outside to provide whatever assistance they can, Urwin is barking orders at some the villagers who have mustered whatever items they can to use as weapons.

Heading to the gates of town, the adventures spot the Burgomaster rallying the town guards to fend off the attack and protect the refugees as he has them brought inside the city walls. Father Lucian gathers the children and ushers them towards the church. Lady Wachter and her sons are witnessed standing and watching, avoiding putting themselves in the path of danger.

Izek leads the charge against the wolves, bats and other creatures that are assaulting Vallaki that appears to be orchestrated by the same Dire Wolf that had attacked the adventurers at Madam Eva's camp. Proving his worth and fierce reputation true, he routes the beasts just as Vidar and Sorrow prepare to help in the fight and the guards cheer their victory. 

Vidar heals the injured, earning a heartfelt thanks from the weary Baron. The Burgomaster informs them that the attack caught them off guard and so the refugees are welcome to stay within the walls of Vallaki to ensure their safety. Vidar mentions that the Wachters did not contribute to the defence of the town and  Baron Vargas reiterates his opinion that they are nothing but trouble for Vallaki. He also confirms that the book club that Lady Wachter has started is more nefarious than it sounds but does have enough information to use as evidence against her.

Their conversation is abruptly interrupted as the Baron looks out of the gates, bewildered by what he sees. The Dire Wolf that had lead the attack is no longer across the field, in it's place is an ominous figure standing defiantly with a hood that covers all but his smiling face. They watch as he turns and leisurely leaves the battlefield.

Vidar and Sorrow offer to escort the Baron as he checks how the rest of  the town fared during the attack.

The sun rises, waking Lars, Aeli, Marcus and Ireena. Packing their camp, Aeli spies a raven perched atop a fallen branch with a note attached to it's leg. She reads it the rest of the group, "DANGER, DANGER. Urwin's father is here with us." signed by Danika Martikov.

Cautious of the true author of the note, they press on still headed towards the winery. 

After a few hours of walking the road, the group come to a cold mountain lake enclosed by misty woods and rocky bluffs. Thick fog creeps across the dark, still waters. The trail ends at a grass-covered causeway that stretches a hundred yards across the lake to a flat, marshy island with a stone tower on it. The tower is old and decrepit, with collapsing scaffolds clinging to one side where a large gash has split the wall. Timeworn griffon statues, their wings and flanks covered with moss, perch atop buttresses that support the walls.

Could this be the tower Madam Eva foretold? *"Look for a wizard's tower on a lake. Let the wizard's name and servant guide you to that which you seek."*

Parked near the base of the tower, within sight of the entrance, is a barrel-topped wagon spattered with mud.

Lars inspects the wagon, and sees that under layers of mud, this wagon sports a fresh coat of purple paint, and its wheels have fancy gold trim. A brass lantern hangs from each corner, and red drapes cover a tombstone-shaped window on each side. A steel padlock secures the back door, hanging from which is a cheap wooden sign that reads, “Keep out!”

Looking to gain entry into the tower, they make their way to the tower door, made of iron, with no visible handles or hinges. Marcus' magical inclinations reveal something wards this tower and that he would not be able to use his magic within. In the middle of the door is a large, embossed symbol — a connected series of lines with eight stick figures set around it. Carved into the lintel above the door is a word: Khazan.

Without hesitation Lars knocks on the door setting off lightning that envelops the tower. Aeli and Lars brace themselves while Marcus is caught off guard and is knocked unconscious by the blast.

Dragging themselves to safety, the group see a brightly dressed young woman running towards them. Ezmerelda d’Avenir introduces herself as the protégé of Rudolph van Richten the vampire hunter ever known. She warns the party about her concerns that the setting off the trap has alerted Strahd's minions to their presence and they must escape quickly, suggesting Vallaki is the safest/closest option .

They begrudgingly agree, and without having made it to the Wizard of Wine Winery make the journey back to Vallaki. As a precaution, Ezmerelda hands Aeli and Lars a silvered shortsword each and educates them on werewolves.

Looking for a way to rid themselves of the possession by the ghost of the Durst children, Sorrow and Vidar move to St Andal's Church. They are greeted by a strapping young lad who is helping to guard Father Lucian and the children he is overseeing with nothing but his shovel for a weapon.

Father Lucian is able to help the pair with what they seek, revealing that one of the relics found in the church can assist them with performing a banishment ritual but they will need something from a man named Emeric who resides near the Vistani camp on the north side of town. He requests discretion, as Emeric's assistance may draw unwanted attention that could put him at risk. The priest also humbly request a small donation to the church for his services, and they hand over a topaz necklace acquired during their travels.

On their way to the camp they witness a couple of figures in black robes, reminiscent of the black robed figures in the Durst House, entering the Wachterhaus back entry.

The northern woods part to reveal an expansive clearing: a small, grass-covered hill with low houses built into its sides. Fog obscures the details, but they can make out that these buildings feature elegantly carved woodwork and have decorative lanterns hanging from their sculpted eaves. Atop the hill, above the fog, is a ring of barrel-topped wagons that surround a large tent with a column of smoke pouring out through a hole in the top. The tent is brightly lit from within. Even at this distance, the odors of wine and horses that emanate from this central area ... the Vistani did always find a reason to celebrate life.

As the possessed pair approach the house at the base of the hill, they find standing quietly in front of this house, bathed in the warm light of its lanterns, are three sullen, gray-cloaked figures, their angular features and black, flowing hair half-hidden under their cowls.

These figures however are not like the others they have encountered in Barovia, these were elves but paler in complexion, with pale white skin, fair hair, and light violet eyes. A memory is triggered abruptly within Vidar as he recalls the fortune given by Madam Eva, *"Look for a dusk elf living among the Vistani. He has suffered a great loss and is haunted by dark dreams. Help him, and he will help you in return."*

Kasimir Velikov, the leader of the three guards, steps forwards to interrogate Vidar and Sorrow about their intentions in the camp. He leads them to Emeric's house, inquisitively asking questions of the pair as they walk. Kasimir's curiosity peaks when Vidar mentions that Madam Eva's foretold that they would be able to help each other.

As they bid farewell Vidar invites Kasimir to join him for a drink at the Blue Water Inn onto discuss further.

A nervous Emeric invites Sorrow and Vidar inside and they can see why he would e courage discretion. Emeric's house shows evidence of the skills he has with making potions and tinctures.

He brews the potion that Father Lucian  needs for the ritual, and shares with them a refreshing tea, invigorating Vidar with some of his lost energy.

Eager to rid themselves of their curse, they take the potion and head back to the church, spotting Arrigal heading to the top of the hill as they move.

The hours grows late and the sun starts to set as Vidar and Sorrow return to Father Lucian who leads them outside to the shed near the graveyard which has been prepared for the ritual.

Father Lucian, with the help of Milijov to hold them down and protect them from harming themselves or each other, hands them each a cup filled with the special potion. He explains that it will put them into a deep sleep while he performs the ritual.

They both drink the potion and it immediately starts to take effect. Their heavy eye lids stay open only just enough to see the priest retrieve a small brass sceptre and an aged leatherbound tome before they fall into a deep sleep.

On the path back to Vallaki, the travellers decide to set up camp for the evening rather than push on into the night.

Ezmerleda sits atop a fallen tree to rest and remove her prosthetic leg. Keen to share stories of their exploits, Ezmerelda drags out the details of the encounter the group had with the shambling mound, impressed by their skills and tactics.

To repay them, she also shares her encounter with a pack of werewolves that ultimately led to Ezmerelda losing her leg after a nasty bite from the pack Alpha.

The group settle down for the evening for an undisturbed night's rest.

As the sun rises the campers quickly pack and make the rest of the journey to Vallaki. The evidence of the recent attack is visible, as villagers work tirelessly to repair damaged walls and the guard presence at the gate into town has increased.

With questions and no answers, Ezmerelda suggests they head to the tavern to see if they can find her mentor as he is known to be able to spin a story to earn some coin and free drinks wherever he travels.

---

At the Blue Water Inn, Sorrow and Vidar wake up and are confused, unsure of how they came to be there. They also realise that finally they are the sole owners of their own bodies, the influence of the Durst children gone.

Downstairs, Danika confirms that Kasimir did come looking for them last night but they had not been dragged back to their rooms.

Embarrassed, they both head to see Kasimir at the Vistani camp. Heearing that Madam Eva knows about his dreams,  he offers to a way they can help each other achieve their goals. He would like their help to enter the Amber Temple and restore his sister from death and free her soul from the eternal torment of being trapped in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.

Spooked by the approaching Arrigal, Kasimir agrees to find them at the Inn to continue their conversation in private.

Arrigal, amused by the presence of Vidar and Sorrow brags about the benefits the Vistani have by serving Strahd, and being granted permission to escape the mist whenever they would like. Looking for a way home, Vidar tries to persuade Arrigal to share the secret to travelling the mists. Arrigal concedes that if they had enough coin, perhaps a Vistani could provide them with a tincture that would grant them the safe passage.

Sorrow and Vidar take their new found information back to the Inn to formulate their next steps.

Sitting at a table, they spring to their feet and rush to greet Lars, Aeli and Marcus as they enter the tavern, offering sincere apologies for their actions.

The group, together again, trade information but their conversation is interrupted. Father Lucian burst through the doors and heads straight to the adventurers, pleading with them to help as something terrible has happened.

What could have happened that has the priest so panicked?
