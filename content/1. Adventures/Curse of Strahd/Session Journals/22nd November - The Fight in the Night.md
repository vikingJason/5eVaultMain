## Session Overview 


The party followed the trail of blood through the dark wet streets of Vallaki.

Stopping at the gates, Vidar asked the guards if they had seen anything suspicious. The drenched guardsman hurriedly sputtered that some Vistani had come through but he didn't bother too much to get a good look at them as the Vistani often head in and out of town.

Sneaking through the cover of darkness it became apparent that something was off, Kasimir and his guards were no where to be found. Sorrow leads the group to Emeric's house, finding that it had been ransacked.

A moment of dread started creep over the adventurers as they realised that the usual sounds of celebrations and libations from the Vistani were replaced this evening with a sombre silence, broken only by the heavy rain.

They make their way up the hill, the air is tense with flickering campfires, shadows moving ominously through the thick fog.

The wagons surrounding the tent show no signs of anyone inside. Horses, secured to stakes driven into the ground, stomp their feet and neigh when they sense the approaching party.

Aeli and Marcus stealthily move around the edge of the wagons to try and get a better look at what is going on inside the tent. Aeli spots Milivoj inside, bound and beaten, surrounded by a small group of armed Vistani. Some of the Vistani are talking to each other, stern concentration splayed over their faces.

Concentrating hard, Aeli and Marcus try to overhear what they are discussing. Over the sounds of the heavy storm they can make out the conversation is about bones,  one of them mentioning that "the boy won't leave here alive. He knows too much."

All the while, Sorrow and Vidar have initiated their idea. Sorrow stalks over to the closest horse, cutting it's reign and prodding it to leave.

The spooked horse neighs loudly and races down the hill. One of the Vistani emerges from the tent, the group hold their breaths as they becoming one with their surroundings, hiding from the Vistani as he gives chase to the horse.

As Vidar looks off to see if he can keep tabs on the Vistani, the night sky is too dark. Suddenly a flash of lightning breaches and Vidar is face to face with a creature

Sorrow moves through the remaining bands of horses, tampering with their reigns as Vidar changes into the form of Lady Wachter, and then into her clothes.

The adventurers regroup, Aeli and Marcus share what they had discovered and they decide on the plan of attack.

Sorrow and Aeli, move through the shadows towards the entrance to the tent.

Marcus takes a position where he can observe and provide support where needed.

Vidar invokes an illusionary duplicate of himself as Lady Wachter to draw out the Vistani from the tents.

While the illusion is at work, a Vistani member leading a horse is returning back up the hill.

The subterfuge is realised and a fight breaks out.

More and more Vistani emerge from the tent, weapons in hand. The group recognises that Arrigal, the one who gave them a letter sending them on their journey together, is leading the attackers.

Hidden in the shadows, the group prepare their attacks.

The Vistani use their strength in numbers to their advantage, pinning Aeli away from Sorrow, Vidar and Marcus.

Vidar, still in Lady Wachter's clothes and unarmoured moves back to support his companions, healing when needed and using his celestial gifts to hurt the Vistani from afar.

Sorrow moves quickly through the battlefield to deliver blow and blow from her trusty swords.

Marcus draws his arcane abilities to summon a prism of fire that burns his attackers, harming the horses and causing some of them to rear up and breaking free from their bindings thanks to Sorrow's interference.

As the native Barovians fall to the adventures, Arrigal and his lieutenant start to turn the tides in their favour.

Sorrow is knocked to the ground, Marcus rushes to stabilise her and then she is healed back to her feet quickly by Vidar.

Arrigal moves around the wagons and delivers a devasting blow to Vidar, bringing him down. The imposing figure gives the remaining party an opportunity to surrender. The offer is rejected and the brave warriors fight on. Standing strong, Arrigal is defeated and the group can take a moment to catch their breath.






The storm lashed against the cobblestones of Vallaki as the party followed the trail of blood, their steps weighted by urgency. Rain slicked their cloaks, and the smell of wet earth mingled with something darker, more foreboding. The air felt charged, as though the tension had woven itself into the very fabric of the night.

When they reached the gates, Vidar stepped forward, his voice cutting through the downpour. "Have you seen anything unusual tonight?"

One of the guards, drenched and shivering, glanced around nervously before muttering, "Vistani came through a while back. Didn’t look close; they come and go often enough."

That small clue spurred the party onward. But as they neared the Vistani camp, something felt off. The usual sounds of revelry—the songs, the laughter, the clinking of mugs—were conspicuously absent. In their place was an eerie silence, broken only by the rhythmic drumming of rain against the earth.

The camp loomed ahead, shadows shifting against flickering campfires. The wagons that encircled the central tent stood empty, their interiors dark and lifeless. Horses tethered nearby stamped their hooves uneasily, their ears twitching as if sensing the tension.

Aeli and Marcus moved with practiced stealth, slipping between the wagons. From a vantage point, Aeli caught sight of Milivoj inside the central tent. He was bound, beaten, his face streaked with blood. Around him stood a group of armed Vistani, their voices low but serious. Concentrating, Aeli caught fragments of their conversation through the storm: something about bones, and a grim assertion that *“the boy won’t leave here alive. He knows too much.”*

Meanwhile, Sorrow and Vidar executed their distraction. Sorrow approached one of the horses, slicing through its reins and giving it a sharp prod. The animal bolted, whinnying loudly as it raced down the hill. The noise drew one of the Vistani from the tent, and the group held their breath as he pursued the fleeing horse into the darkness.

Lightning flashed, illuminating the night—and Vidar found himself face-to-face with a figure that made his blood run cold. Yet the moment passed, and Vidar’s mind shifted back to their plan. He donned the illusion of Lady Wachter, her face and fine clothing an eerie echo of the woman they had bested only hours ago.

The party regrouped in the shadows. Aeli relayed what she and Marcus had overheard, and together they formed their plan. Sorrow and Aeli would approach the tent’s entrance, Marcus would hold position for support, and Vidar would use his illusory guise to draw the Vistani out.

The trap was sprung when Vidar’s illusion strode boldly into the camp. One by one, the Vistani emerged, suspicion etched on their faces. But before their ruse could be fully realized, a returning Vistani leading a horse spotted them, and the game was up.

Battle erupted. The storm roared as steel clashed against steel. Vistani surged from the tent, their numbers threatening to overwhelm. At their head stood Arrigal, his presence commanding and familiar. It was he who had first drawn the party together with a mysterious letter, and now his blades turned against them.

The fight unfolded in a chaotic blur. Aeli was separated from her companions, fighting fiercely to hold her ground. Sorrow darted between the wagons, her twin swords a whirlwind of steel and blood. Vidar, still clad in the guise of Lady Wachter, moved to support his companions with radiant healing and searing celestial power. Marcus summoned a fiery prism that burned their foes, scattering the horses and sending chaos rippling through the camp.

But Arrigal and his lieutenant fought with grim determination, their strikes deadly and precise. Sorrow fell to the ground. Marcus rushed to her side, stabilizing her until Vidar’s magic brought her back to her feet. Yet even Vidar could not escape unscathed—Arrigal struck him down with a brutal blow, his offer of surrender ringing out over the battlefield.

The party refused.

In the storm’s fury, under the unrelenting darkness of Barovia’s skies, they fought on. Arrigal’s strength began to falter, his movements slowing as the adventurers pressed their advantage. And then, at last, the decisive blow landed. Arrigal fell, and silence descended once more.

The adventurers stood in the aftermath, their breaths ragged, their wounds stinging. Rain washed away the blood, but not the memory of the fight. They had won, but the price of survival in Barovia was always steep. For a moment, they simply breathed, the storm above mirroring the tempest of emotions within.
