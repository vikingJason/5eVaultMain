## Session Overview 


Vidar and Sorrow took the bones and started to make their way to Father Lucian.

They all stopped in their tracks when they saw that the coffin maker was dead, fear sending chills down their spines.

Lars inspected the body closer, spying  two tiny puncture marks in his neck and the blood drained without making a mess.

The faintest of footsteps trailed the creature who attacked Henrik van der Voort from where he sat, lifeless, to the wall and then along the roof.

This concerned Lars, Aeli and Marcus. They suggested staying in place and resting up to regain some of the strength and stamina they lost fighting the Vampire Spawn upstairs.

Vidar and Sorrow disagreed, theirs sights set on achieving only one goal - returning the bones back to the church. The pair set out, leaving their companions behind. The streets of Vallaki were dim, the heavy clouds above and the fog that littered below made the walk along the quiet streets more ominous.

As they neared the town square they were met with a parade of unhappy children dressed as flowers trudging through the muddy streets, leading the way for a group of sorry-looking men and women carrying a ten-foot-diameter wicker ball. The burgomaster and his smiling wife, who helds a sad bouquet of wilting flowers, follow the procession on horseback. As weary spectators watch from their stoops, the ball is borne to the town square. There, it is hoisted and hung from a fifteen-foot-high wooden scaffold, and townsfolk take turns splashing it with oil. 

As Vidar scanned the crowd, he saw a dark figure, standing tall from a balcony and looking down on the crowd. This sinister presence brought a sense of foreboding and dread, but Vidar was distracted as the sky tore open in a sudden downpour. “All will be well!” cried the burgomaster as he brandished a sputtering torch and marched defiantly through the rain toward the wicker ball, only to have his torch go out as he thrust it into the sphere. 

The crowd grew silent, the Burgomaster impatient and the crowd restless.

"Tiger," someone yelled, warning the crowd about a dangerous beast that was on the loose. The crowd disbursed in panic, running in all directions.

---

Aeli, Lars and Marcus, heard the frantic screaming coming from town square and left the safety of the coffin maker's shop to investigate and make sure their friends were safe. They crossed paths with Rictavio, who was rather tight lipped but confessed that it was his pet tiger, Piccolo, that had gotten loose somehow.

They agreed to keep an eye out for the tiger and kept on their way. Aeli spotted Vidar and Sorrow down the road and hurried after them, leaving Lars and Marcus as they continued their search around town.

---

As they got closer to the church, a crowd of villagers escaped the church doors and starting running towards Vidar and Sorrow. They approached with caution, unsure of what dangers awaited inside. Kasimir, hiding behind a nearby shack caught their attention and beckoned them over.

Aeli caught up to the trio as Kasimir explained that Strahd was inside the Church of St Andral and he was terrorising the parishioners. They requested Kasimir find Lars and Marcus while Aeli, Vidar and Sorrow scouted ahead.

---

Marcus and Lars were drawn to a loud roar in the bushes behind the houses on the street. Through the leaves patches of orange fur gave away the creature that had the town on edge.

Rictavio appeared, and called over his beloved pet and thanked the pair for all their help.

The shouts of the town guards searching for the tiger was cause for concern for Rictavio who pleaded with the pair to distract them so that he and Piccolo could escape. As he left, he told them to meet him at his tower on the lake so that he could reward them.

Marcus and Lars waited as Izek and his watchmen drew close. When the Captain asked about the tiger, Marcus' antics were enough to frustrate him into storming off.

Kasimir found the pair and summoned them as he was asked to do. They quickly moved towards the church and their friends.

---

Impatience coursed throughout Vidar and he entered the church, unable to wait any longer to rescue the priest. He was met by a grim scene, empty pews and an unconscious Father Lucian lying in front of the alter.

Aeli and Sorrow followed in Vidar, keeping vigilant. Vidar knelt down to heal the priest as Lars and Marcus walked through the doors. As Vidar helped Father Lucian to his feet, an imposing man with jet-black hair swept back from his face revealed himself, his laugh booming throughout the sacred building. His intense red eyes, were a stark contrast to his exquisite finery.

Strahd von Zarovich addressed his audience, boasting his power over the realm the requirement for obedience from his loyal subjects. 

He demanded the bones that the group had almost their life to retrieve be handed over to him, threatening the priest with a show of his strength. Vidar tried to reason with Strahd but acquiesced and gave over the bones.

The now free Father Lucian started to head for the exit doors. Lars prepared his bow with an arrow and took aim, prompting Strahd to fulfil his promise of killing the priest.

The ensuing fight was tough and one by one, the visitors fell to the Vampire lord.




 Yet, the eerie quiet of Vallaki’s streets seemed oppressive, like the town itself had grown afraid to breathe.  
 


### Session notes

The bones weighed heavily in Vidar's hands as he and Sorrow prepared to leave the coffin maker's shop, their resolve driving them toward Father Lucian and the safety of the church.

Behind them, Aeli, Lars, and Marcus lingered, their steps halted by the sight of Henrik van der Voort's lifeless form. His body lay crumpled where it had fallen, two pinprick wounds on his pale neck, the blood drained clean with clinical precision. Lars crouched, studying the scene, his brow furrowing as he traced faint, unnatural footprints leading up the wall and across the ceiling—evidence of the predator that had claimed the coffin maker's life.  

Marcus, Lars and Aeli, exhaustion etched into their faces, suggested the need to rest.

But Vidar and Sorrow had already passed through the threshold, their determination cutting through the unease like a blade. “The bones must reach Father Lucian,” Vidar said without looking back, his voice steady. "The church cannot wait for us to feel ready."

The streets of Vallaki seemed to close in around Vidar and Sorrow as they advanced. The clouds above churned, heavy with the threat of rain, and the mist at their feet coiled around their ankles like grasping hands. The silence was broken only by the distant murmur of voices—uneasy, restless.  

As they neared the town square, the murmur grew into a strange, dismal scene. A line of children trudged through the mud, their faces downcast and their arms weighed down by garish costumes shaped like flowers. Behind them came a procession of weary townsfolk, bearing a massive wicker sphere atop their shoulders. The burgomaster rode behind on horseback, his ever-present smile stretched unnaturally wide. His wife followed, her hands clutching a bouquet of drooping flowers, their petals gray and lifeless.  

The procession ended in the square, where the wicker sphere was hoisted onto a tall scaffold. Townsfolk splashed the sphere with oil, their movements mechanical, joyless. The burgomaster raised his torch high, shouting over the first drops of rain, “All will be well!”  

Vidar scanned the square, his eyes drawn upward by an instinct he couldn’t name. There, standing still as a statue on a shadowed balcony, was a figure cloaked in darkness. Though the face was obscured, Vidar felt its gaze pierce through him, carrying a weight that settled cold and heavy in his chest. The rain fell harder, extinguishing the burgomaster’s torch as he thrust it toward the wicker sphere.  

The silence that followed was brittle. The crowd shifted, restless. Then a single word, shouted in warning, cracked the moment like a hammer on glass: “Tiger!”  

Panic erupted. Villagers scattered, their screams echoing through the streets as the crowd dissolved into chaos.  

---

Back at the coffin maker’s shop, Aeli, Lars, and Marcus heard the commotion carried on the wind. Without hesitation, they left their place of uneasy rest to investigate. It wasn’t long before they crossed paths with Rictavio, the enigmatic carnival master. His face was tight with barely concealed frustration, his words clipped. “It’s mine,” he admitted reluctantly. “The tiger—it’s loose. Piccolo. Someone let it out.”  

The words left an uneasy silence in their wake, one that none of them were eager to break but they agreed to keep an eye out and continued on their way.  

---

The road to the Church of St. Andral was filled with tension. Vidar and Sorrow moved with purpose, their focus sharpening as they saw the shadow of the church spire through the mist. But as they approached, a wave of villagers came rushing out, their faces pale with terror, Sorrow's hand instinctively reaching for her weapon.  

From the shadows of a nearby shack, a figure emerged—Kasimir, the dusk elf. He beckoned them over urgently. Vidar’s hand tensed at the sight of him, but the elf’s expression was unmistakably grim.  

“Strahd is inside the church,” Kasimir said, his voice a low whisper, as though afraid the very air might betray him. “He’s terrorizing the parishioners. You don’t have much time.”  

Aeli arrived moments later, her breath hitching as she joined them, her gaze on Kasimir as she requested he find Marcus and Lars and bring them immediately.

Kasimir nodded, vanishing back into the mist as Aeli, Vidar, and Sorrow turned their eyes toward the church. The door loomed before them, dark and foreboding, the faint sound of voices from within twisting into cries of fear.  

Aeli glanced at her companions, her fingers tightening around her sword. “Let’s see what’s waiting for us.”  

---

Marcus and Lars were drawn to the guttural roar echoing from a dense tangle of bushes behind the crooked line of houses. A glint of orange fur shifted through the shadows, betraying the presence of the creature that had plunged the town into chaos. They tensed, weapons at the ready, until a figure emerged—Rictavio, his breathless voice rising over the tension as he called for his pet.

The tiger padded out of the undergrowth, its movements a mix of raw power and surprising grace. Rictavio approached it with a steady hand, whispering something soothing to the beast before turning to Marcus and Lars. Gratitude filled his expression, though the urgency in his voice belied his calm demeanor. The town guard was closing in, their shouts growing louder. Rictavio pleaded for a diversion, a moment to escape with his tiger, Piccolo.

Before vanishing into the foggy night, he turned back, his voice low but heavy with promise. "Meet me at my tower on the lake," he said, "and I will repay this debt."

Moments later, the clinking of armor and heavy boots heralded the arrival of Izek and his watchmen. The captain's harsh glare fell upon Marcus and Lars. "The tiger," he demanded. "Where is it?"

Marcus adopted an air of feigned innocence and spun a tale so maddeningly evasive that it sent Izek stomping off in frustration. Lars barely stifled a chuckle as they watched the guards scatter to resume their search.

Kasimir appeared next, his movements quiet but purposeful. With a terse nod, he relayed the summons from their companions. Without hesitation, they followed him toward the church.

---

Vidar’s patience frayed like a taut rope on the verge of snapping. The church loomed ahead, its familiar silhouette shadowed by dread. Without waiting for the others, he pushed open the heavy doors and strode inside. The sight that met him was a grim tableau: the pews stood empty, and Father Lucian lay crumpled before the altar, his breathing shallow.

Aeli and Sorrow followed, their steps cautious as they scanned for signs of danger. Vidar knelt beside the unconscious priest, channeling his divine energy to heal the man’s wounds. Before Father Lucian could fully rise, the church seemed to darken. Footsteps echoed, slow and deliberate, and a figure emerged from the shadows of the nave.

Strahd von Zarovich.

The vampire lord’s presence was suffocating. His jet-black hair gleamed in the faint candlelight, swept back to reveal his angular features. His crimson eyes burned like embers, stark against the elegance of his attire. His laugh, deep and mocking, reverberated through the sacred space.

"You’ve gone to such lengths," Strahd said, his voice smooth as silk but sharp as steel. "And for what?"

His gaze fixed on Vidar, piercing and unrelenting. "Hand them over," he commanded, gesturing toward the relics the group had fought so hard to recover. "Or I will demonstrate the price of defiance—on him."

Vidar’s jaw clenched as he weighed his options. The bones, the priest, their lives—it was a cruel arithmetic. He tried to reason with Strahd, but the vampire’s smirk deepened, his patience thinning. Reluctantly, Vidar placed the sacred remains into Strahd’s waiting hands, the sense of failure like a lead weight in his chest.

Freed from the vampire’s grasp, Father Lucian staggered toward the door, his steps faltering. Lars, bow in hand, drew an arrow and took aim at Strahd. The motion was swift but not unnoticed. Strahd’s crimson eyes flicked to the ranger, and his smirk vanished. In a blur of movement, he reached out, snapping the priest’s neck with a single fluid motion.

The church erupted into chaos. The group attacked as one, but Strahd moved with an unearthly grace, every counter a precise and devastating blow. One by one, the companions fell, their strength no match for the vampire lord’s overwhelming power.

As darkness claimed the room, Strahd stood unchallenged, his shadow stretching long over the fallen.














Vidar stepped forward, his mace in hand, and pushed open the door. The church’s sanctuary stretched before them, dim and oppressive, and the figure waiting in its center was unmistakable. Strahd von Zarovich turned slowly, his crimson eyes catching the faint light like embers in the dark.  

“Well,” Strahd said, his voice smooth as silk. “The shepherds return to protect their flock.”  

And the door swung shut behind them.
