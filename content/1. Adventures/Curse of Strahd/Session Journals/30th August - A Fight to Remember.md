## Session Overview 

Sitting around the campfire, Marcus is approached by a pair of Vistani named [[Eliza]] and [[Arturi]] who introduce themselves. The pair graciously offers the hospitality of the warm fire to the group, educating them on the Vistani tradition of celebrating life before enquiring where they have travelled from. They are both keen to hear more once they hear that the group recently departed from the village of Barovia, explaining that they haven't heard from anyone in the village for some time.

Eliza retires to her wagon for the evening, and Arturi stays behind to ask the adventurers if they had run into his friend Rictavio during their time in the village. The party confirmed that they had not encountered any such person; a disappointed Arturi asked them to deliver the message that he needs to see his friend should they meet him.

As the night ages, the Vistani either head back to their wagons or pass out around the campfire. The group welcomes the opportunity to rest, setting up shifts to keep watch while out in the open. At first, it seems their sleep will be undisturbed this evening, only small forest creatures moving about as expected. Aeli notices that some flying creatures are suspiciously circling above, but she can not discern what they are or their intentions. Marcus hears the creaking wheels of a small cart being pushed down the road echoes through the night. Vidar subtly wakes his companions as he confirms that a threat is approaching, with a pack of wolves led by a Dire Wolf attack.

Vidar valiantly puts himself in a position to protect Ireena, and the rest go on the attack. They fend off the wolf attack while the oblivious Vistani sleep through it. Before the party can focus their attacks on the Dire Wolf, it transforms into a bat and flies away, stunning them all.

Feeling uneasy about staying in the camp much longer, the adventurers finish their rest and move on. Not stopping to take in the sights of the Tser Falls, they find themselves at another stone buttress looming grey in the fog and pause the journey to have a meal break.

Ireena expresses to Lars that she was impressed with his bravery and strength as he gallantly defended her and his friends from the wolves, but her true intent is not so obvious to the oblivious Lars.

With the threat of nightfall before reaching Vallaki looming, the party continues on their journey and finds themselves at a fork in the road with one path leading to Vallaki and the other in the direction of a large Windmill, that Vidar and Aeli recall may be linked to the Durst House.

Suddenly, the cries of a child draw their attention to the same old lady from the village pushing her cart toward the windmill and heading inside. Sorrow springs to action, followed quickly by Aeli and Vidar who all rush toward the domed edifice that leans forward and to one side with grey brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building’s interior. Perched on a wooden beam above the door is a raven. It hops about and squawks, seemingly agitated before flying off as the trio heroically rushes inside.

The ground floor has been converted into a makeshift kitchen, but the room is filthy. Baskets and old dishware are piled everywhere. Adding to the clutter is a peddler’s cart, a chicken coop, a heavy wooden trunk, and a pretty wooden cabinet with flowers painted on its doors. In addition to the clucking of the chickens, toads can be heard croaking.

The sweet smell of pastries blends horridly with a stench that burns the nostrils, the awful odour coming out of an open, upright barrel in the centre of the room that Aeli inspects finding it to hold glistening, greenish-black ichor.

Warmth issues from a brick oven against one wall, and a crumbling staircase ascends the wall across from it. Shrieks and cackles from somewhere higher up cause the old mill to shudder. The small human bones litter the floor loudly crunch underfoot as they ascend the stairs.

The haggard, heavyset old woman, Morgantha, with a face as wrinkled as a boiled apple sweeps the floor, pushing around a few old bones and stirring up a cloud of white dust with her broom. Aeli, Vidar and Sorrow confront the woman about her actions and the condition of the children, she tries unsuccessfully to matter-factly convince the trio that she is well within her right to charge what she charges for her Dream Pastries and that if they can't pay then it is on the parents. Not happy with the accusations and line of questioning she demands they leave.

The unsatisfactory answers and unwelcoming attitude lead to a fight, as the human old lady transforms into a repulsive and even more withered form, her skin turning darker and villainy gleaming from her eyes.

Marcus and Lars, while waiting outside see swarms of ravens approaching but rush inside when they hear the shrill scream of the Morgantha shatter the windows above.

They join the fight, as two ugly young women wearing silk shawls and gowns of stitched flesh join to protect their mother and form a coven giving them all a deeper well of magical strength to draw from, the hags use their powers to curse Marcus, paralyzing Lars and hurl lightning at Vidar and Aeli.

The fight is tough, thankfully the swarms of ravens enter through the open windows and join the fight against the hags, with one of the ravens taking a more humanoid form.

They defeat one of the Morgantha's daughters, breaking the coven and reducing their power. Then the second daughter is defeated, and all the attention turns to Morgantha. Morgantha's defeat is sealed by the party, bringing justice to her countless victims.
