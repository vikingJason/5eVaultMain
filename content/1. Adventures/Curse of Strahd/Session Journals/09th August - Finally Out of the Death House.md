## Session Overview 
 
Continuing the escape from the Durst House, the party find their path hindered by yet more slashing scythe-blades. [[Sorrow]], not wanting to tempt fate, tries to attack the wall and is able to carve out a chunk. [[Aeli]], taking out her long sword, finishes the job exposing a path forward, and another swarm of rats.

After they make haste of the rats, they continue down the stairs to the nurse maid's chamber. Not wanting to wait for the blades to get him, [[Lars]]  breaks through the wall, falling to the floor of the smoke filled room.

More rats emerge from the new hole in the wall, and the party are able to deal with them easily. [[Aeli]] continues to push forward, and quickly learns that it seems all doorways are now replaced with the dangerous blades.  

[[Sorrow]] taking another opportunity to avoid the blades,  attacks the wall and hacks a chunk out. [[Aeli]] runs and bursts through the partially damaged wall, exposing another swarm of rats.

The party press on after defeating the swarm and [[Vidar]] inspired by the party's ingenuity, suggests that they break through the wall leading straight outside. [[Sorrow]] tries breaking through the outer wall, but the attempt leaves no sign of damage. 

As the party walk down the large spiral staircase, they realise that the black smoke is emanating from all  fireplaces and filling the house with thick poisonous gas. [[Lars]] succumbs to the smoke, going down and springing [[Vidar]] to action. [[Vidar]] pushes his body past it's limits even further as he draws on the power of [[Tymora|Tymora]] and revives [[Lars]].

Getting desperate and trying something different, [[Vidar]] walks through the bladed doors leading to the Conservatory. [[Aeli]] and [[Marcus]] double back to find [[Vidar]], and revive him them drag him away from the danger.

[[Sorrow]], almost tasting freedom tries to slip past the blade and successfully gets through unscathed seeing that the mist is receding. [[Lars]] tries to imitate her success but a coughing fit from the black smoke causes him to stumble and he is hit by the blades reducing him to unconsciousness. [[Vidar]] makes his attempt but is also brought down by the dangerous blades.

[[Marcus]] prepares himself to make it through and launches himself at the blades. The party, certain they saw him hit by the slashing tools of death, appears on the other side unharmed. Influenced again by desperation, [[Marcus]] picks up and throws [[Vidar]] through the doorway, luck on his side as [[Vidar]]'s body lands over the border of the Death House and into freedom.

[[Aeli]] takes a moment, recognises a pattern in the spinning and throws [[Lars]] through successfully and follows right after. [[Marcus]], the last of the party inside the house braces and prepares to get through the door, the blades stopping and falling aside to let him simply walk on by.

A young blonde hair man quickly approaches, reviving [[Lars]] with a health potion. Showing great concern for their safety, he tells them to follow him to a location where they can rest.

Leaving the house behind, a loud rumbling sounds commands their attention as the house shudders violently before crumbling into itself. As the adventurers follow their new guide through the town they can't help but notice that the eerie silence is broken only by a wailing from the distance. They continue and their gaze is drawn by the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles to a hunched old lady, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog with a small sign complimenting the tantalising scent of delicious pastries.

A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.







A dark figure presents himself, asks [[Marcus]],  to kill someone who is after his disciple - in exchange for full health, no exhaustion and a boost to his power - tell no one of this
