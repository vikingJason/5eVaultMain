- The Demiplanes of Dread
    
    - Once upon a time, there was an entire dimension called the Core as big and wondrous as Faerun. But, over the course of time, this dimension was split into a multitude of small, isolated dimensions. Demiplanes, to be more precise. Barovia is one of these demiplanes.

- The Dark Powers
    
    - Why did the big dimension get split up? Because of the Dark Powers.
        
    - The Dark Powers are essentially a pantheon of old, dark gods. They’re very powerful, usually sinister beings.
        
    - Each demiplane has a ruling Dark Power. That god basically owns that particular mini world. However, these gods cannot actually own a plane just by wanting it. Instead, they choose a champion amongst mortals and form a sort of pact with them. That mortal becomes the Dark Power’s anchor to that particular demiplane.
        
    - The Dark Powers are always at war with one another, essentially fighting for real estate. It’s possible for one Dark Power to supplant another as ruler of a particular demiplane, provided they too have a chosen champion in that plane.
        
    - In CoS, the Dark Power that rules over Barovia is named Vampyr (original, I know). As written, Vampyr is trapped in a vestige at the Amber Temple. However, I've changed this so that Vampyr is free, lingering in the mists that surround Barovia. Strahd is Vampyr’s chosen champion to rule over Barovia, therefore giving Vampyr dominion over this demiplane.


# Background: Before the Mists

Barovia wasn't always a Demiplane of Dread, of course. What was the valley like _before_ Strahd arrived? The following background is a mix of cannon lore, ideas borrowed from other amazing writers here on reddit, and my own imagination. This is the lore which I use throughout the entire Fleshing Out series.

- Druidic Tribes
    
    - _Long_ before Strahd's reign and any official settlement, the valley was once home to a collection of nomadic, druidic tribes. These folk lived entirely off the land and were completely unsettled. They are, in fact, the ancient ancestors of the druids and barbarians found in the book.
        
    - Forest Folk
        
        - I've never liked referring to these people as "Druids" or "Barbarians" in game, because it automatically tips off your players as to the basic stats and abilities of the enemies they're facing. It can break immersion, even if only a little.
            
        - Instead, I refer to these tribes of primitive peoples as the Forest Folk. Or, if we're referring to the tribes that live in the mountains, the Mountain Folk. Simple, clean, and easy to remember.
            
        - In the present date of the campaign, the native Barovians still refer to the wild peoples who live in the woods as forest folk. Or, sometimes, less flattering terms.
            
- The Fanes of Barovia
    
    - The forest folk of old used to worship a trio of archfey known as the Ladies Three. The Ladies were extremely powerful nature goddess who watched over the valley. They were:
        
        - The Huntress of the Mountain Fane
            
        - The Weaver of the Swamp Fane
            
        - The Seeker of the Forest Fane
            
    - The Fanes are technically official Ravenloft lore found in previous editions but not mentioned at all in CoS. The subreddit community has resurrected them, and updated them for some awesome storytelling. Now they've become an integral part of the campaign.
        
- Settlements
    
    - As time went by, certain forest folk along with a mix of settlers from other lands established small villages in the valley. These settlements were tiny, each home to no more than a handful of families living in makeshift huts.
        
    - In time, four major settlements rose in the valley. These were the precursors to the towns in the CoS book. They are: The Village of Barovia, Vallaki, Kresk, and Berez. Although, they were known by other names in the past.
        
    - Most of these people, settled or not, still actively worshiped the Ladies Three.
        
- The Mages' Arrival
    
    - At one point, a little over a thousand years ago, a great circle of mages wondered into the valley. These mages had dedicated their lives to studying, understanding, and defeating great evils of a magical nature. In their studies, they discovered the Dark Powers and hoped to somehow subdue the evil gods.
        
    - The mages were looking for a place to found a base for their research. Not only was the valley beautiful and rich in magic, it was also remote, flanked by impassable mountains. These mages went on to build the Amber Temple on Mount Ghakis, and subsequently all died at the hands of their own good intentions.
        
    - However, the coming of the mages also lead to a sort of industrial boom for the settlements of the valley. The villages grew in population and became much more civilized.
        
- Strahd's Arrival
    
    - As the book says, Strahd was busy fighting wars in distant lands. At one point, he followed those enemies to the valley and discovered the beautiful land.
        
        - Now, I'm not entirely sure about this, but I _think_ the book says Strahd became a vampire about 250 years before the campaign. Even for a vampire, this seems just a tiny bit short in my opinion. I personally pushed the dates back farther to about 700 years.
            
        - However, that is entirely my preference. So long as Strahd feels like a concrete, immovable fixture in Barovia, he can be as old as you want him to be so long as he fits okay into the general history.
            
    - Strahd claimed the valley as his own, naming it Barovia. He brought another wave of civilization growth to the already established towns and build Castle Ravenloft for his mother.
        
    - Though Strahd himself was never a terribly religious man, his people and soldiers also brought the religion of the Morning Lord to the valley, which spread rather quickly.
        
    - Strahd also discovered the Amber Temple in these early days and began conversing with the Dark Power Vampyr.
        
- The Mists Cometh
    
    - The rest of the fall of Strahd and Barovia occurs as the book says. The Sergei and Tatyana event pushed Strahd over a mental and emotional edge and he gave into the Dark Power who had become his companion. Strahd became a vampire and the mists cut Barovia off from the rest of the universe.
        
    - Repressing the Ladies Three
        
        - In the very early years of his vampiric reign, Strahd set about making himself even more powerful, so that no one could challenge his post.
            
        - Strahd committed three terrible acts of desecration at the main shrines to the Ladies Three and stole their power over the valley. The Ladies, while still alive at the time of the campaign, are almost completely powerless now.
