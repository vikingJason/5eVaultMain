## Description



The Kiduzian Federation is a large country with a huge population of [[3. Mechanics/Races/Aarakocra|Aarakocra]], [[3. Mechanics/Races/Centaur|Centaur]], [[3. Mechanics/Races/Kenku|Kenku]], [[Loxodon]], [[3. Mechanics/Races/Minotaur|Minotaur]], Owlin, [[3. Mechanics/Races/Tabaxi|Tabaxi]], [[3. Mechanics/Races/Tortle|Tortle]], Harengon, [[3. Mechanics/Races/Lizardfolk|Lizardfolk]], Yuan-ti

Bordered between The Emerald Waves to the West, Iseyesari to the South, Erradirn to the East and The Abyss of Cressano to the North,

The Federation is mainly covered in jungle and has a temperate climate, which has lead to a stretched population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in small settlements.

Their flag has two horizontal stripes and a triangle in light yellow, light gold, black and brown. Their coat of arms is a lion on top of two small circles

Built upon a history of enslavement, prejudice and betrayal of it's past, this state is now among the most distrustful countries in [[Kaedimoor]].

Their education, food production and housing are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately they lack a little in natural resources and hygiene.

The Kiduzian Federation is a nation of individual states where the different species all self govern through various forms of governance, yet all fall under the leadership of The Council of the Exalted Tooth, a council made up of the leaders from each state within the Federation. There are no opposing groups against the current leadership but who knows how long that will last.

The current greatest threat to the nation is climate change, already affecting the soil and rivers and lakes impacting their ability to effectively manage their farms and other food sources, but the current leadership is unable to solve this issue.

The people of Kiduzia are are gratified. They live fine lives and while natural resources might be lacking, their easy access to a variety of exotic foods helps relieve most of their issues.

Religion holds quite some importance in their lives and, if anything, has made them more light-hearted. They aren't very spiritual however and they, but they do have firm beliefs and strict rules.
