## Description


The Commonwealth of Iseyesari is a large country with a huge population of [[Elf]], [[Gnome]], [[Half-Elf]], [[Fairy]], [[3. Mechanics/Races/Satyr|Satyr]], Shadar-kai

Bordered between The Emerald Waves to the West, Kiduzia to the North, Erradirn to the North East and Borfaldor to the East,

The Commonwealth is mainly covered in forest and has a warm climate, which has lead to a fairly disbursed population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in huge towns and citadels throughout the commonwealth.  
  
Their flag has five horizontal stripes in dark silver, dark grey and brown. Their coat of arms is a bow and arrow on top of two small circles

Built upon the virtues, vitality and kindness of its past, this state is now among the most happiest countries in [[Kaedimoor]].

Their understanding of magic, access to clean water and sustainability are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately they lack in industry and public safety.

Iseyesari is a democratic nation, where members from the 3 opposing political parties are elected to represent and lead their peoples. The current majority party in power is [[The Ebon Horn Conclave]]  and any opposition to their governance is generally via peaceful protests.

However, the current greatest threat to the nation is the rise of a cult of religious zealots [[The Praxus Inquisitors]], but the current leadership is incapable to solve this issue.

The people of Iseyesari are gratified. They live fine lives and while industry might be lacking, their vitality and easy access to magic users helps relieve most of their issues.

Religion holds great importance in their lives and, if anything, has made them more dedicated. They are quite spiritual as well and they have intriguing rites of passage and beautiful customs.
