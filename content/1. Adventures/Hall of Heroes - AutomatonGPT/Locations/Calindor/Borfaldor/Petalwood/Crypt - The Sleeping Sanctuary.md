# `=this.title`
> [!info|bg-c-purple] Description
> 
> The Whispering Mausoleum is a small, weathered structure nestled in a secluded corner of the graveyard. Its exterior is adorned with intricate stone carvings depicting scenes of mourning and remembrance, while ivy creeps up the sides, adding an eerie beauty to the somber facade. At night, the moonlight casts haunting shadows across the crypt, giving it an otherworldly aura.
> 
> As you approach The Sleeping Sanctuary, a chill runs down your spine, and a faint scent of earth and decay fills the air. The sound of rustling leaves and creaking branches overhead adds to the eerie atmosphere, while the soft glow of torches flickering by the entrance casts long shadows on the ground.
> 
> Upon entering the crypt, you're greeted by the cool embrace of darkness, broken only by the dim light of flickering torches lining the walls. The air is thick with the musty scent of old stone and dried herbs, and the sound of your footsteps echoes eerily in the silence. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you can make out rows of ornate sarcophagi and dusty cobwebs stretching across the ceiling. In the distance, you hear the faint whispering of voices, sending shivers down your spine.

> #### Owner
> **`=link(this.ownerName)`** is a tall, gaunt figure with sunken eyes and a perpetual air of solemnity. Dressed in somber black robes, he moves with a quiet grace, his footsteps barely making a sound on the stone floor. Mortimer is the sole caretaker of The Sleeping Sanctuary, overseeing burials, maintaining the crypt, and tending to the needs of grieving families.
> 
> When the players walk in: Mortimer Grimwood is seated at a small desk near the entrance, poring over a dusty ledger by the light of a flickering candle. He looks up as the players enter, his expression grave but welcoming. "Welcome to The Sleeping Sanctuary," he says in a voice as soft as a sigh. "How may I assist you?"
