> [!info|bg-c-purple] Description
> A two-story inn built from sturdy timber and adorned with intricate carvings depicting fantastical creatures. A weathered wooden sign creaks gently in the breeze, displaying a troll with one hand resting possessively on a overflowing sack of coins, while the other clutches a hefty club. Below the troll, a winding path snakes across the sign, leading towards a silhouette of a rickety bridge spanning a murky river. Smoke curls from a chimney, promising warmth and hearty meals within.

> #### Owner
> **`=link(this.ownerName)`** is a plump halfling woman with eyes that sparkle like emeralds, runs the inn. When the players enter, she'll be wiping down a table with a flourish, humming a tune that seems to echo the otherworldly music outside. A young human boy named Finn scurries around, refilling mugs and cleaning up after patrons.
