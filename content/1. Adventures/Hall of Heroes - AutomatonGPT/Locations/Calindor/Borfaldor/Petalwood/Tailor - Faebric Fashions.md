> The storefront is appears to be a mishmash of colorful fabrics draped over an old oak tree, forming a whimsical canopy that dances in the breeze. A sign hanging above the entrance depicts three mischievous pixies wielding needles and thread, their wings shimmering with iridescent hues.
> 
> As you step inside, the air is filled with the scent of lavender and jasmine, emanating from sachets strategically placed around the cozy interior. Shelves lined with bolts of silk, satin, and velvet stretch to the ceiling, each roll adorned with sparkling embroidery and intricate patterns. Sunlight filters through the leaves above, casting a warm glow over the assortment of garments and accessories on display.

> **`=link(this.ownerName)`** are a trio of pixies named Thimble, Thread, and Tinsel. Thimble is a spirited pixie with a knack for intricate embroidery, Thread is the practical one, skilled in tailoring and mending, and Tinsel is the mischievous troublemaker who adds flair to their creations with glitter and sequins. As the players enter, Thimble is perched on a spool of thread, meticulously stitching a delicate lace collar, while Thread is measuring fabric for a custom gown, and Tinsel is fluttering about, sprinkling fairy dust on a whimsical cloak.
