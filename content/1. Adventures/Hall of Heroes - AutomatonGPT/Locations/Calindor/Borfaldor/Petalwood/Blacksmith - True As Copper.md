> [!abstract] **Description**
> **Exterior:** True As Copper is a sturdy stone building with thick walls and a wide chimney that constantly billows smoke. The exterior is adorned with metal gears and cogs, giving the shop an industrial feel. A large iron sign depicting a hammer and anvil hangs above the heavy wooden door.
> 
> **Interior:** The inside of the shop is warm and filled with the sounds of clanging metal and the hiss of steam. The walls are lined with weapons and armor, all meticulously crafted and polished to a shine. Workbenches are scattered around the room, cluttered with tools, metal scraps, and half-finished projects. A forge glows brightly at the back of the shop, where the automaton owner, Forge, works tirelessly.

> [!abstract|background-color-purple]  **Staff**
> Forge, the automaton owner, is a tall, humanoid figure made of bronze and iron, with glowing blue eyes and a resonant voice. As the players enter, Forge pauses its work, the clinking of metal halting as it turns to greet them with a slight mechanical whir.
