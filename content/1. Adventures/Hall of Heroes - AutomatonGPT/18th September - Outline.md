- [[Bax]]'s daughter tells him that he looks like the Guardian of the [[Shimmering Cave]], from her favourite bed time story. (including the runes)
	- It is a story about the of the "Kobold of the Fey",  a kobold with a flower beard, a Red Cap, and  Runes etched into his scales, who arises when the cave is in danger, to protect the luminous crystals and precious gems from being stolen. (the source of the Fey Magic)
	- The Guardian Must pass a series of test to prove he is worthy.
		- Memory isn't too great and can't remember the story details - which is great because it's like a new story every time he reads it to his little girl
		- They can have the book
	- The illustrations in Bax’s daughter’s storybook, the same one that introduced Rinji to his destiny, contain subtle clues.
		- Bax's daughter has "decorated" some of the pages in the book. Pages with illustrations on it, you can see that she has added her own special touch, drawing in herself holding hands with the Guardian, giving the villains stink lines. But on one page that shows the Guardian fighting under the night sky, she has drawn lines to connect the star clusters making her own constellations, one of the constellations  looks similar to the runes on Rinji.
	- These constellations are key to locating the Shimmering Cave.
	- The only other information is about the author, Venelien Swiftbranch, who has since sought reclusion high up in the mountains near Borfaldor.


- help [[Brother Vallas]] secure a Sacred Moonstone blessed by [[Sehanine]] to perform a sacred ritual during the lunar eclipse to strengthen the connection between Calindor and the Feywilds
