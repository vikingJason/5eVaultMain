To tell the history of Calindor, one must first look at the history of the Nebula Oasis. This, but one of many islands in the Dreaming Isles was once a vast and peaceful land, ruled by the wise and benevolent Eladrin, a powerful and magical race. But all that changed ten thousand years ago when the forces of the Abyssal Lords invaded. In the resulting Conflict of the Primordials, the Eladrin were brought to the brink of devastation and the Eladrin were forced to flee their homeland.

They sailed to Calindor, where they built a new city, Glitterfall and they ruled Calindor for many centuries. But even in Calindor, the Eladrin were not safe and this new found peace did not last and they were besieged by the ferocious orc chieftain Grommok Bloodrager and his Warband, the Onyx Mauraders. The war with the orcs last years and devasted the Eladrin, and as a result their realm was divided into a four petty duchies, Borfaldor, Kiduzia, Eradirn and Iseyesari, with Glitterfall as their capital city in ceremony only.

For many years, the duchies of Calindor warred with each other, and the realm was in chaos. But then, a young man named Conciliator Perrinos rose to power. He was a wise and benevolent ruler, and he brought the duchies together to create a unified realm, assuming the new name and title of King Calindeseus.

This was a major turning point in Calindor's history known as the Convergence, as it marked the end of the era of individual dominions and the beginning of a unified realm. This was a time of great collaboration and harmony, as the different peoples of Calindor came together to create a better future for themselves.

The realm became a center of trade and commerce for all of the Feywilds. Calindor's merchants traveled far and wide, bringing goods and ideas from all over. This helped to enrich Calindor's culture and make it a more cosmopolitan place.

While Calindor basked in the light of abundant knowledge and burgeoning magic, Archmage Bolzanos, a luminary of power and vision, raised a tower that pierced the very heavens. The spire of the tower reached into the vaulted skies like an ambitious dream given form, its pinnacle brushing against the tapestry of clouds, the Tower of Luminaria. A sanctuary where practioners of the magic arts could refine their craft, where the weave of magic could be spun into intricate patterns of might and marvel. Thus, the Tower of Luminaria became a haven, a crucible of arcane enlightenment.

Calindeseus' family ruled Calindor for many generations, with each successor a strong and just ruler continuing Calindeseus' legacy of peace and prosperity.

But Calindor's peace was not to last. A dark force was rising in the Underdark, and it soon threatened to overrun the realm reigned over by King Thoras. This force was led by Aurzath, a powerful drow warlord. Aurzath and his armies invaded Calindor, and the realm was plunged into a dark age known as the Blight.

The people of Calindor fought bravely against the Blight, but they were outnumbered and outmatched. Just when it seemed like all hope was lost, a young woman named  Lorawenys rose through the ranks and lead the final assault against the invaders. She was a brave and loyal soldier, who fought valiantly and earnt the admiration and respect of all. She was a symbol of hope and courage, and was selected to lead the Knights of The First Order, the company of guards that protect the crown and those that wear it.

With King Thoras' declining health after The Blight, King Thoras abdicated from the throne and passed the crown on to his daughter, Clarice Thramfhaer.

What followed was a period in Calindor's history known as the Purge, a religious war on those who were seen as heretical and worshippers of the old Gods. Sparked by a charismatic preacher disenfranchised after seeing the atrocities that occurred during the Blight, his fervent words igniting the flames of zealous conviction blaming the old gods and those that served them for letting the Underdark forces invade. Known as the Moonshadow Prodigy, he spoke of a singular deity whose dominion overshadowed all others, whose light would cleanse the realm of the heretical worship that had found refuge in the heart of the Feywilds and would provide protection against all so that they could live in peace.

The embers of faith burst into conflagration, and a tide of devoted adherents surged forth. Violent mobs would gather under the banner of the Moonshadow Keepers, their purpose to purge Calindor of heretics who followed the old gods.

Amidst the tempest of chaos that raged throughout the realm during the Purge, Queen Clarice embarked on a path of restoration that mirrored the very principles of peace and justice she held dear.

With unwavering resolve, she reached out to both the victims of the Purge and those who had been swept up in the fervor of zealous conviction. She opened the doors of her palace to hear their tales, to share in their sorrow, and to stand as a living testament that empathy could mend even the deepest wounds, establishing the Court of Reconciliation.

Under Queen Clarice's just and compassionate rule, Calindor began to mend and what followed was known as The Prosperity. The Prosperity was a golden age for the realm of Calindor. The people of Calindor were free to live their lives as they saw fit. They were not burdened by taxes or tithes, and they were free to worship any god they chose. The realm was a haven for artists, scholars, and craftsmen, and Calindor's culture flourished during this time.

The Prosperity was also a time of great technological advancement. Calindor's engineers and inventors developed new methods of farming, mining, and manufacturing. This led to a period of economic growth, and Calindor became one of the most prosperous realms in the world.

It was during this period that met Alandrinon, a local magistrate. Born of disparate stations, Queen Clarice's heart knew no bounds as it entwined itself with Alandrinon. Their clandestine meetings were stolen moments of rapture, a love that defied the dictates of nobility and birthright. Yet, as their love blossomed like the rarest of flowers, shadows danced in the periphery. Whispers grew into murmurs, murmurs into rumors, until the truth could no longer be veiled by the shroud of secrecy. Alandrinon, the embodiment of a forbidden love, was seized by the cold hands of justice, his crime not in deeds of malice, but in daring to love where birthright dictated he should not.

Amidst the turmoil a revelation bloomed, Queen Clarice, carried within her the embodiment of their love—a child. It wasn't long before Clarice gave birth to a girl, Iyvaine Reeva Fayetta Thramfhaer. As Alandrinon was not of noble birth this was considered a crime against the Royal Family. Alandrinon was sentenced to death alongside his new born child.

Queen Clarice, with the weight of the realm upon her shoulders, faced a choice that would forever shape its course. Clarice confirmed the sentence of death and administered the punishments herself as is customary.

It is speculated however that Clarice ordered the First Order to sneak away her daughter and lover to a secret location as she could not bear to watch them killed.

Clarice was matched with a more appropriate suitor and soon after they are wed. Shortly into their marriage Clarice gives birth to a son, Magnus Vurgoda, who is trained to be a skilled warrior, besting any who challenge him.

Much of the years that follow are peaceful and uneventful, Calindor continues to prosper. A growing faction that are loyal to Magnus (who has assumed the name Thunderhead) grow in popularity amongst the courts of the realm, securing his influence over matters of state.

One fateful evening it is announced to all of Calindor that Queen Clarice had died. Her death it is considered suspicious by many, however no one is able to prove that and it is proclaimed to be an unknown illness.

When Thunderhead is proclaimed to be the successor to the crown, Calindor is plunged into chaos. Factions loyal to Queen Clarice openly clash with those loyal to Thunderhead and while contained to street brawls at first, it eventually leads to hillside skirmishes and eventually Civil War.

The death of Queen Clarice was a tragedy for Calindor. She was a beloved leader, and her death was a great loss to the realm. The Civil War that followed her death was a time of great division in Calindor, as the realm was torn apart by a war between the forces of Queen Clarice and those loyal to Thunderhead. This was a time of great sadness and loss, as Calindor's people were forced to choose sides in a conflict that they did not want.

As though fate was on the side of good, Reeva found herself in Calindor, thrust into the conflict of her realm.

Reeva was not alone.
Nox, a Gnome Warlock, sacrificed his connection with his patron to siphon their power at great personal risk.
Dorgle, the various clones of the orphaned Dwarf, found themselves bound to the royal cause.
Daehorn, a local Firbolg Warlock, grew to love the princess.
Beldroth,  a stoic elf ranger, was never far from Reeva's side protecting her with his deadly bow.

With the aid of her valiant heroes, were able to rally the peoples of Calindor and unite them in the pursuit of freedom.

Many of the inhabitants of this realm quite clearly remember what life was like thirty-two years ago, when Calindor was a fractured land, still reeling from the iron fist of the tyrant Thunderhead. It was a time of strife, whispers of rebellion echoing through the ravaged city-states. Then, a phoenix rose from the ashes – Queen Reeva, a fiery revolutionary who rallied the fractured Houses and drove back the darkness.

Peace, when it finally arrived, was a balm, but a fragile one. Reeva, our stoic Queen, shouldered the weight of a thousand burdens after her coronation. First and foremost was how to mend the wounds left by Thunderhead's loyalists, their hearts still harbouring whispers of dissent? In the same spirit of compassion that her mother ruled with, Reeva re-opened the Court of Reconciliation, a decision many counselled was fraught with risk yet yielded inspiring results as the remaining forces loyal to Thunderhead either laid down their arms, or swore fealty to Reeva.

The coffers of the city-states bled dry, the scars of war a constant reminder of the trials they endured, Queen Reeva spared no expense and invested all of Calindor's resources into rebuilding after the tyrannical rule of Thunderhead and the destruction he left in his wake, fostering the trust and loyalty of the population, however rumours can still be heard to this day that high ranking military advisors and officers were unhappy with the decision as it had left the kingdom vulnerable to external or internal threats.

A brilliant but eccentric scholar claimed to have discovered a way to rid Calindor of the changing colours of the night sky. Reeva gave support to this scholar's research, their arrogance led to them taking shortcuts in their work and performed the ritual that they had uncovered without the proper preparations,  unleashing an unpredictable force that shifted Calindor to a new demiplane caught between the Feywilds and the Material Plane, severing the bond between the resident fey and the plane of Faerie and perverting the magical laws that shaped the realm.

**The Rule of Hospitality:**  Instead of genuine hospitality, anyone entering a dwelling must participate in endless, nightmarish entertainment for their "host." This could involve playing deadly games, enduring humiliating performances, or facing bizarre challenges with no hope of escape.
**The Rule of Ownership:** Everyone is expected to barter, to lie, cheat or even steal to get more than what they pay for
**The Rule of Reciprocity:** The concept of "gift" is replaced by a constant cycle of debt and obligation. Favors are expected to be repaid with interest, creating a system of manipulation and control

(Anyone not following the rules will start to suffer levels of exhaustion or role on a [[Wild Fey Magic Surge Table]])

And most contentious the decision of all, should Calindor embrace a new dawn, a system of rule unheard of – democracy? This has been rolled out on a small scale, with local villages moving towards the system of government where their leaders are elected rather than appointed by some special right. This move has seen outcomes that were predicted and others that weren't. There was an immediate reduction in reported corruption from the villages far from the capitals, citizens feeling they have a stake in their day to day lives lead to a greater social stability and an increase in productivity, especially in the gathering and processing of raw materials.

But this era of progress did not last as long when just over a decade ago, a virulent plague swept across the land, decimating much of the working class and wreaking havoc on the growing prosperity of the kingdom, causing a lockdown of borders between realms and strict curfews. Trade slowed to a halt due to fear, livestock and crops were left to rot with no one to tend to them and crime was on the rise. It was Reeva's crucible, her greatest test. With unwavering resolve, she forged a pact with [[The Whispering Court]] who agreed to provisions for the Fey creatures of the Wildlands to help work the lands in exchange for fairer compensation for their work and freedom of travel between Calindor and the rest of the Feywilds. This bargain, however, was a source of much debate amongst the population.

This is the tapestry upon which your own tale begins.  Will the choices you make will echo through the realm, shaping the destiny of Calindor itself? The answer, as always, lies in the adventure ahead and the choices you make.
