### **Mythology**

Sehanine Moonbow is a goddess of the moon, stars, and dreams, and an embodyment of the quiet strength and resolve of the moon. She is a protector of those who walk in twilight, the boundary between light and dark, and is often revered as a guardian of life’s transitions—birth, death, and spiritual transformation.

Though her beauty and wisdom are legendary, her role as a divine arbiter of justice is often overlooked. Sehanine does not merely offer comfort to her followers; she demands their resilience. To Sehanine, justice is not served by blind faith or fleeting convictions. Instead, she tests her followers' resolve, ensuring that they can endure the trials and adversities that righteousness often entails. These tests are not punishments but opportunities for growth, a reflection of her belief that inner strength is forged in the crucible of hardship.

Sehanine is also a weaver of fate and dreams, guiding mortals through visions and omens. Her presence is felt most strongly on nights of the full moon, when her light shines brightest and her voice is clearest.

### **Personality and Motivations**

Sehanine is serene, enigmatic, and nurturing, yet she carries an air of divine authority. While she is gentle with those in need, she has no patience for cowardice or apathy. Her compassion is balanced by her unwavering commitment to justice and the greater good.

She believes that her followers, like the moon, must shine even in the deepest darkness. Thus, she frequently sets challenges before them—dreams that reveal hard truths, encounters that test their morals, and paths that force them to confront their fears. Those who rise to these challenges earn her blessings and become beacons of light in their own right.

Sehanine is not vindictive; her tests are always purposeful and fair. However, she does not shield her followers from the consequences of failure. To her, every setback is a lesson, and every trial overcome is a step closer to true righteousness.
