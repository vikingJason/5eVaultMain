## Session Overview 
 
**Fireday, 5th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

After agreeing to help Ellywick and Lerendrie, Achroteth and Cedrick take their new found information and join the rest of their group downstairs. As the hours of the evening grow late, the adventurers look to finish their meals and retire for the evening.

Still unable to speak without dandelions spewing from her mouth, Fawn can only listen and again hears a voice in her head who begins to question the lack of prayer and thanks. Fawns asks for guidance from the voice and is told to find Brother Varrus but is given no other information.

During the dinner service Martha hands Cedrick a letter, who opens and reads it in secret, it is a thank you letter from Laundithas who is very appreciative that Cedrick made the connection to his Guild Master Dorgle. There is even a gift inside as a token of appreciation, a set of blueprints that can be used to repairs the goggles that Cedrick's father had given him.

As the party retire for the evening they set about winding down at the end of another long and eventful day in Petalwood.

Achroteth opens the window and perform his nightly prayers, observing that on this special evening that some of the constellations shine brighter than others, while a normal occurrence it is always a breath-taking sight to see.

Rinji knocks on Achroteth's door and when he enters, he shares that he is experiencing a strange feeling after killing Felgan, hinting that Rinji is starting to feel remorse and may even be growing a conscience.

Cedrick studies the blueprints and deciphers that there are a few special components he will need to complete the repairs, the first piece he needs is a Shard of a Magic Magnifying Glass.



**Starday, 6th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

The next morning during breakfast the party start to make plans and preparations for the day ahead but are distracted at the realisation that Rinji's face is no longer adorned with a beard of flowers that they had all become accustomed to. The first stop for the day is Town Hall, on the way Achroteth shares with Fawn that they learned the blacksmith and his wife Ellywick had lied, not only on the report that they filed about Fey stealing from them, but also lied when they confessed that the Neighbourhood Watch paid them to lie on the report, and after receiving a scolding from Cedrick and Lullaby they wish to do the right thing moving forward.

Eagerly they arrive at Town Hall to meet with Mayor Finroth but their progress is halted as they are told that we will need to wait a little for the mayor as the council is currently in session. Making efficient use of her time, Fawn makes some enquiries with Glendelle about where to secure enough tables and chairs for the Royal Gala.

Glendelle admits that no one in town would have enough tables currently, but suggests that they could request that the Townsfolk bring their own table and chairs.  finds out that there wouldn’t be enough tables and chairs for everyone in town. Seeing that the answer is not satisfactory, she also suggests that they could talk to Motalon, he is the local Lumber supplier and could provide the lumber to have enough tables and chairs built.

The party continue their wait to see the Mayor and spy a pair of townsfolk excitedly enter and start a hushed conversation with Glendelle who hands them some forms. Trying to find out what has caused the excitement, the party start a friendly conversation and the villagers nervously share that they are simply looking for a wedding permit. Unconvinced Lullaby sneaks over to peek at the form, and quickly reads that is a mining permit request form before they quickly snatch it up and leave.

The party head in to the Council Chambers and speak with the mayor who concedes the concerns about the way that the Fey are being treated and that the current course of action is not good for Petalwood. He petitions Fawn to extend the original plan of the Royal Gala and repurposes it into a Unity Festival, a celebration of diversity and coexistence spanning over three days to repair the damage to the strained relationship.

They discuss all manner of details before agreeing to Finroth's request. Expertly negotiating for the town to pay 20% of the costs. Ensuring that Fey be allowed to be involved in the planning process. 

Recognising that they are more than capable and appreciative of what the group need to do to have everything prepared in time, Finroth gives them full reign to plan whatever entertainment, food, drink and events they deem fit for such a celebration asking that they check in daily with an update on how the plans are coming along.

Finroth and the council also agrees to an emergency measure to relax the need for all administrative requirements and red tape for the time being so that preparations can be made in haste.

With their plans slightly changed the group head to the Faebric Fashion. Loving the designs that Thread, Tinsel and Thimble have drawn up, she request some additional outfits to compliment her adventures. Lullaby and Cedrick also place an order for some finer garments, and are sized up by the excited pixies.

Waiting outside the store, Achroteth and Rinji spot a pair of Green cloaks moving through town with purpose and unusually paying no mind to the people of the street. Rinji stalks them to True as Copper and tries to spy on them through the window but can't see much as his breath fogs up the windows. Persistently he continues to make out anything that may be useful and is surprised when they exit the store with picks and shovels in hand. Quickly regaining his composure he intimidates them into revealing that they have been asked to pick up the tools and take them back to their headquarters.

Rinji makes his way back to Achroteth and as the others leave the shop a familiar voice booms over the hustle and bustle of the busy street, “Is that Rinji?”. Turning to see who is approaching they see Bax with his daughter in hand moving towards the group with a large gleeful smile upon his face. 

Bax's daughter, Suphocatia, interrupts her father and nervously shares that Rinji looks like the hero from her favourite book. She shows them the book, "The Guardian of the Shimmering Cave", and opens it to some of the picture of the hero, the Champion of the Shimmering Cave, a Kobold wearing a Red Cap, landing on a picture of the Champion standing heroically under the night sky.

Some of the illustrations has been "decorated" by Suphocatia who has added her own special touch, drawing in herself holding hands with the Champion, giving the villains stink lines. But on the page that shows the hero posing under the night sky, she has drawn lines to connect the star clusters making her own constellations ... somehow one of the constellations  looks exactly like one of the runes on Rinji's scales, but how could that be?

Saying their goodbyes to their best friend, Bax and Suphocatia gives Rinji a hug, joined by Lullaby and Fawn who give Rinji yet another public bath, this time though it is a bath of affection.
