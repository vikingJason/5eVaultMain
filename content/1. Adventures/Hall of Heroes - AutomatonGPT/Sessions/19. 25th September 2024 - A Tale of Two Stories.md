## Session Overview 
 
**Fireday, 5th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

Noticing [[Dorgle]] adding a few more notches to his sword, [[Achroteth]] enquires about them with his friend. [[Dorgle]] shares that he has encountered these creatures before and that those things were other Dorgles, claiming one of the heads of the creatures as a trophy.

Arriving at the Fight Club, the group quickly checks in and splits up. [[Dorgle]], keen to become the champion of the arena, heads to the Fighter's Lounge and organises a sanctioned match, being paired against Rideeq.

[[Achroteth]] and [[Lullaby]] are directed towards the kitchen, and when they get there, they see a gathering of Redcaps working meticulously around a big wooden kitchen bench. A Redcap with a large red chef's hat overseeing the operation of the kitchen barks order and order at the Redcaps, to which they all respond in unison, "Yes, chef!" [[Achroteth]] is given the pelts he was promised and heads back to the stands to watch the next match.

Cedrick makes his way to the betting booths and places a bet on [[Dorgle]] to win his match.

Back at [[The Troll's Tollbooth]], [[Fawn]] heads downstairs to enjoy some tea. While awaiting her beverage, a young, dishevelled-looking boy comes in, asking the patrons of the tavern for money to buy food. The patrons, including [[Laundithas]], all give him money. The child approaches [[Fawn]] and introduces himself as Charmwell, laying on the sob story about needing to buy food for his siblings. During the interaction, Martha emerges from the kitchen and hurls shouts at Charmwell, who takes off.

Martha reveals to [[Fawn]] that Charmwell and the other kids are known for pickpocketing and asks the guests to check their pockets, who all look frustrated when they learn that some of their belongings are now missing.

Learning that times have been tough for the whole village, [[Fawn]] takes the opportunity to walk around town, trying to get more information on what hard times have fallen on some of the townsfolk.

Strolling the streets of [[Petalwood]], she offers to assist Wain and Gawrth with their heavy load. They resist the help but allow [[Fawn]] to accompany them, and she uses the time to gather more information before continuing on her mission.

Walking through the town square, she spies Charmwell tracking an unsuspecting villager in the town square and calls out to him to prevent any further misdeeds. She starts to ask some questions before a look of fear blooms on Charmwell's face as he turns to take off and flee from the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] approaching. [[Fawn]], exhausted with the group's methods, secures some time to search for Charmwell and bring him in for questioning.

The time for [[Dorgle]]'s fight is at hand, and "The Gnarly King" enters the arena to face off against Rineeq, "The Slippery Eel". The fight does not start well for [[Dorgle]] who is dominated by Rineeq who stands back and fires arrow after arrow from his longbow.

When all hope looks lost for [[Dorgle]], Rineeq's bowstring snaps, and [[Dorgle]] closes the gap to turn the tide in close-quarter combat. [[Dorgle]] wins his first sanctioned match, collects his prize money and signs up for another fight.

Cedrick collects his winnings and the group gathers to start the journey back to town. [[Achroteth]] sends a bird to give [[Fawn]] a heads-up that they are on the way to [[Petalwood]].

The bird catches up to [[Fawn]] who is still searching for Charmwell. Watching the bird fly off she finds Charmwell hiding on the roof of an abandoned-looking house.

[[Fawn]] enters the house and convinces Charmwell that she wants to help, on the provision he promises not to mention anything to anyone about it. As she leaves, she is engulfed with wild Fey magic and instead of words, dandelion puffs explode when she tries to speak. 

[[Fawn]] heads to Town Hall and gladly learns that the proposals have been approved and that Finroth has a few questions for her when she has some time to speak.

The party all gather at [[the Troll's Tollbooth]] when Ellywick enters and asks to speak somewhere more private. [[Achroteth]] and Cedrick lead her upstairs to a private room. She reveals that she and her husband were not entirely truthful when they spoke earlier and shows a large blue gemstone. Ellywick says that her husband found the stone under an oak tree that is home to a dash of Quicklings. 

She and her husband want to do the right thing, negotiate with the Quicklings to mine the gemstone and share the profits without disturbing their home. She asks for help, negotiating with the Quicklings and organising the mining permits. Ellywick reveals that their substantial debts were being called so had to buy themselves more time which is why they filed the false report.

Cedric identifies the gemstone as a Blue Sapphire and they discuss breaking it into smaller pieces to sell. They may have stumbled onto something very profitable ... but at what cost?
