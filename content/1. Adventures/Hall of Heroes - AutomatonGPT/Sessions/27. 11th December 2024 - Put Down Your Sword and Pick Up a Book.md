## Session Overview 
 
**Elday, 7th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Four Days Until the Unity Festival!

While Lullaby has headed out to find Finroth to help convince Lilareth, Achroteth continues his attempts to persuade the Scribe to their cause. Lilareth eventually agrees when Achroteth let's her know that Finroth is planning sweeping reforms to make the process of governing easier. 

Excitedly, Lilareth shares that she has been looking for ways to improve efficiency and is overcome with joy when Achroteth suggests she put forward a few changes to the rules.

She retrieves her notebook and is a series of flourishes and squiggles, starts prioritising her ideas on a chalk board.

Dorgle and Rinji head outside to resume their role playing as Grand Wizards while keeping an eye on the nearby Neighbourhood Watch.

Alone with Lilareth, Achroteth asks her about if there are any books on Dragons, particularly seeking information on Skull Keeper. Lilareth ponders, and advises the Druid that nothing comes to mind but she will look through and send a message to Martha if she finds anything.

---

Lullaby finds Finroth in his office, and drags him back to the library. Achroteth intervenes, letting them know that everything is sorted.

Achroteth asks if they can speak privately, and tries to reach out telepathically but is surprised when Finroth does not respond. Finroth guides them to the Council chambers and the pair share with the mayor how the preparations for the meeting have gone, confirming that Althea will put forward the vote and the others will vote in favour.

Finroth, eager to keep his promises, clarifies that the town will take temporary control of all Automatons until the referendum can take place. 

With the meetings due to start soon, Lullaby and Achroteth head outside.

---

Finished with their game, Rinji and Dorgle start reading their new books.

Dorgle stares at the symbols on the pages of his book, unsure of what they mean. As an extension of his play time, he commands a spell to help him comprehend languages and the symbols in the page begin to move and swirl about the page. He quickly shuts it, scared and curious.

Rinji is so engrossed with the book that he does not see Dorgle storming straight at some Neighbourhood Watch on patrol.

Lullaby, Achroteth and Rinji all witness Dorgle thrusting his book at the Greencloaks and saying something that cant quite hear.

Dorgle yells, "I cast Fireball" not expecting anything to happen.

A large sphere of fire explodes, catching the Neighbourhood Watch and Dorgle in the blast radius and scaring off the nearby townsfolk.

Irbaron rushes over to help his crew as Finroth appears to investigate what all the commotion is about.

In a fit of frustration, Irbaron blames Finroth for everything that has been happening and that all the troubles seem to be getting worse since the princess and her companions arrived.

With a flamboyant whisk of his cloak, Irbaron takes his Greencloaks to receive some much needed medical attention, and Rinji follows.

---

Lullaby and Achroteth make their way around looking to do some shopping, stopping at Faebric Fashions. 

Thimble, Thread, and Tinsel regretfully inform Lullaby that the magical disruption last night caused issues with their production line and the outfits they had committed to making, might not be done in time.

Lullaby graciously offers to alter his order, requesting only a kilt and sporran instead. As a token of reciprocity, the Pixie's offer to give Lullaby a bolt of cloth but Lullaby declines the gist, causing a standoff.

Achroteth interjects and to ask how someone would be able to shield their mind from telepathy. They explain that some creatures do possess the innate abilities that Achroteth speaks of, but for the most part there are magics that can be used to block telepathy. And if a creature does not possess magical abilities, then a magic item could be used as well.

Intrigued, Achroteth enquires more about the types of magic items that could be used and Thimble shares that almost any common item can be made magical with the right knowledge and components, from something as small as a ring or piece of jewellery to something as plane as a staff much like the one on display.

To appease the rules of Calindor, Achroteth offers to take the favour for Lullaby, receiving the staff as a gift.

---

Rinji, head burrowed in his book, reads of four origin stories of the Shimmering Cave. Each tale revealing something new and fantastical.

But one story sticking out more than the others, The Starlight's Gift, a story that resembles very much of what the Quicklings had shared with them.

Sitting close by and trying to keep a low profile, Dorgle opens up his book again and tries to decipher the messages inside. Again the symbols begin to swirl on the page and he is able to understand their meaning.

He reads about a secret organisation, a group of assassins for hire, that were once feared throughout all of Calindor. Recently, after the disruption that forced Calindor into it's own new demiplane, this secret organisation changed.

This group that had prided itself on being able create brilliant disguises to make themselves look anyone, blend in and infiltrate even the most secure locations, had been turned into creatures that all looked identical but could transform their appearance at will. 

Now known as the Clandestine Insurgency Association, the CIA, these individuals melded into a single hivemind and sow chaos wherever they are found.

It is said that this organisation is motivated purely  destabilise the natural world. Others say that they infiltrate positions of power and influence to amass wealth and power. Some even say that all this group wants is to hunt and destroy the only other creatures that seem to share their clone-like existence - the Dorgles.

The bookworms are interrupted by Lullaby and Achroteth returning, and head back to the Inn.

Achroteth goes straight to his room, requesting only some water from Martha. The air between Martha and Dorgle is still tense and she shows no patience when Dorgle tries to order a drink. She returns with the fruit concentrate for Lullaby, ciders for Rinji and water for Dorgle.

Upstairs, Achroteth begins crafting some clothes. Rinji visits his brother and tells him about the stories in the book he had read, seeking Achroteth's wisdom.

Achroteth glances the pages, pausing briefly on the story of the dragon gods as he ponders the name Serakar, linking it to an ancient draconic dialect for the word for skull.

As the party all begin to relax, the toll of the town bell can be heard, signalling the end of the council meeting - but that isn't the reason why Lullaby's tummy is starting to grumble. 









Lullaby had darted off, his urgency trailing like the flutter of a bird in flight, leaving Achroteth to face Lilareth alone. The library seemed to hold its breath as the druid leaned in, his tone earnest but calm.

His voice resonant as he tried to persuade Lilareth that their proposal isn’t about politics for politics’ sake, and that Finroth is planning reforms—sweeping changes that will make governance not just easier, but fairer and efficient.

At the mention of efficiency, Lilareth’s eyes lit up, the kind of light that scholars reserve for the spark of inspiration. Her lips twitched into a smile, a rare show of emotion from the Scribe.

For a moment, Lilareth was silent, as though weighing his words on the delicate scales of her mind. Then, without warning, she rose. The chair screeched softly against the floor as she strode to a cabinet, pulling open a drawer filled with neatly stacked notebooks. Lilareth admitted that she had been working on a few ideas, her tone now vibrant with restrained excitement.

With a flourish, she retrieved a chalkboard from a corner of the room, her movements precise yet quick. She flipped open a notebook, the pages brimming with dense handwriting and meticulously drawn diagrams. As if forgetting Achroteth’s presence, she began scribbling on the board—lists, arrows, and annotations growing like vines from her pen. Her joy was almost infectious, the room now humming with a sense of purpose.

---

Meanwhile, outside the library, Dorgle and Rinji stood beneath the dappled sunlight filtering through the trees. Their earlier tension seemed to evaporate as they resumed their mock battle of magical wits.

The two of them circled each other, their imaginary duel attracting the occasional curious glance from passersby. But even as they played, their eyes kept drifting toward the patrol of Neighbourhood Watch stationed nearby. The men in uniform stood stiff and silent, their gazes sharp, their presence oppressive.

Dorgle and Rinji exchanged a knowing look. Beneath their playful antics, they remained vigilant.

---

Back inside, the room had quieted once more, save for the soft scratch of chalk on slate. Achroteth, now alone with Lilareth, observed her with a faint smile. Her enthusiasm was a stark contrast to her usual methodical demeanor, but it was clear this was where she thrived.

After a moment, he began to ask a question of Lilareth, his voice hesitant, as though broaching a delicate subject. Achroteth enquired if they had any books on dragons, specifically, anything about the one called Skull Keeper.

Lilareth froze mid-scribble, her chalk hovering just above the board. Her brow furrowed as she considered the question. She turned back to Achroteth, her eyes thoughtful and confessed that while nothing came to mind immediately, she would search the archives and send word to Martha if she found anything.

“Thank you,” Achroteth said, inclining his head.

Lilareth nodded absently, already half-lost in thought as she returned to her notes. The chalk began its rhythmic dance once more, and Achroteth left her to it.

---

Lullaby found Finroth in his office, the mayor’s brow furrowed as he pored over a mountain of documents. Without preamble, Lullaby dragged him back to the library, his energy as relentless as a storm’s gust. But before tensions could rise, Achroteth stepped between them, his calming presence like a balm.

Finroth’s shoulders relaxed, though his eyes remained wary. Achroteth seized the moment, asking for a private word. As they stepped aside, Achroteth tried to reach out telepathically, expecting the familiar mental connection that usually accompanied such attempts. Yet there was nothing. No response. The silence from Finroth was unsettling.

Finroth’s expression didn’t betray any awareness of the attempt. Instead, he gestured toward the Council chambers, leading them through the quiet halls. There, away from prying ears, Achroteth laid out the details of their preparations.

Finroth nodded, his usual air of control slipping for a moment into something like relief before confirming that once the vote passes, the town will take temporary control of all Automatons until the referendum can take place.

The mayor’s tone was resolute, but there was something else beneath it—a flicker of doubt, or perhaps unease. Achroteth made a mental note of it as they returned to the others. The meetings would begin soon.

---

Outside, Rinji and Dorgle, now finished with their theatrics, turned their attention to their newly acquired books. Rinji’s nose was buried in the tome about the Shimmering Cave, his focus so absolute he barely noticed the world around him.

Dorgle, however, was less fortunate. The symbols on the pages of his book swam before his eyes, their meanings slippery and elusive. Frustration gave way to inspiration as he extended his hand, murmuring the incantation for a spell to comprehend languages.

The moment the spell took hold, the symbols seemed to come alive, writhing and swirling across the page like a living entity. Dorgle slammed the book shut, his pulse racing. Fear mingled with a dangerous curiosity, but for now, the tome remained closed.

Before Rinji could notice Dorgle’s distress, the latter stormed toward a patrol of Neighbourhood Watch officers. His movements were brash, his frustration evident. Rinji, too engrossed in his reading, failed to intervene.

Lullaby, Achroteth, and Rinji turned at the same time to witness the scene: Dorgle, holding his book aloft, thrusting it toward the Greencloaks with a defiant shout.

“I cast Fireball!” he bellowed.

It was meant to be a joke. A playful jab at his imaginary wizarding. But the moment the words left his lips, the air seemed to thrum with power. A heartbeat later, a massive sphere of flame erupted from his position, consuming the patrol and Dorgle himself in a chaotic inferno.

The explosion scattered townsfolk, their screams filling the streets. When the flames cleared, the Greencloaks were sprawled on the ground, singed and groaning. Dorgle stood at the epicenter, his face a mix of shock and terror.

Irbaron, the Sheriff-in-Absentia, came sprinting toward the chaos, his expression dark with fury. Finroth arrived a moment later, his robes billowing as he surveyed the wreckage.

“This,” Irbaron snarled, jabbing a finger at Finroth, “this is your fault! Ever since _they_ arrived,” he gestured toward the princess’s companions, “everything has fallen apart. The town’s been in chaos, and now this!”

His words carried the weight of frustration and fear, but they cut through the air like a blade. With a dramatic whirl of his cloak, the sheriff ordered his Greencloaks to their feet so they could receive the medical aid they required.

As they limped away, Rinji, shaken but composed, followed after them, leaving Dorgle, Lullaby, and Achroteth standing in the smoldering remains of the street.

---

The fireball had left more than scorch marks; it had burned away the delicate threads holding the town together. Suspicion and anger now festered openly, with Irbaron’s accusations hanging in the air like smoke.

Finroth’s gaze lingered on Dorgle for a moment, a complicated mixture of anger and something else—something softer, perhaps. Then, without a word, he turned and walked back toward the Council chambers, his steps heavy.

Lullaby and Achroteth strolled off to the bustling marketplace, the morning light catching on vibrant shop signs and magical wares. Their path led them to Faebric Fashions, a boutique of whimsy and wonder, where bolts of shimmering cloth seemed to ripple with their own inner light.

The trio of pixie proprietors—Thimble, Thread, and Tinsel—fluttered forward, their wings shimmering with nervous energy. Their usual cheer was dimmed, replaced by regretful tones as they explained the recent magical disruption had completely stalled their production line and the outfits  promised may not be ready in time.

Lullaby’s expression softened. He waved off their concerns with a gracious smile and offered to adjust the order, asking for a kilt and sporran.

Tinsel’s wings perked up at his magnanimity, and with a flourish, they produced a bolt of cloth, its fabric glinting like morning dew on spider silk and offered a gift as a  token of their gratitude.

But Lullaby, declined the offer, his charm now teetering on the edge of pride. The pixies froze, their sparkling eyes wide, caught in a silent standoff that hung in the air like an unresolved melody.

Achroteth, sensing the tension, stepped forward and asked the Fey tailors how might one shield their mind from telepathy?

Thimble tilted their head, intrigued by the shift in conversation and explained that some creatures are born with such abilities, but for most, magic is the answer—spells, enchantments, or even items imbued with protective properties.

Achroteth’s gaze sharpened. “Items, you say? What kind?”

Thread darted to a nearby shelf and gestured toward a modest staff on display, its surface etched with faint, glowing runes. “Almost any item can be made magical with the right knowledge. Rings, amulets, even something simple like this staff. It’s all about the intent and components.”

The druid considered the staff for a moment, then glanced at Lullaby still frozen in how to respond to the geneous offer from the pixies. Achroteth agreed to accept the favor on Lullaby’s behalf and with a nod, Thimble handed over the staff.

---

Elsewhere, Rinji sat cross-legged on the ground, his nose buried in a tome so thick it could have doubled as a doorstop. The book spoke of the Shimmering Cave, its origins shrouded in myth and wonder.

There were four stories of its creation, each fantastical in its own right, but one tale captured his attention like a whispered secret: The Starlight’s Gift.

The tale mirrored the story told by the Quicklings. Rinji’s finger hovered over the page, tracing the words as his mind raced. The cave wasn’t just a curiosity. It was a gift—and, perhaps, a destiny.

Dorgle sat hunched over in a quiet corner, his stubby fingers gently turning the worn pages of his mysterious book. Its symbols swirled and shifted as though alive, forming words he could somehow decipher.

The story it revealed was chilling. Once, a shadowy group of assassins prowled Calindor, masters of disguise who could infiltrate any bastion of power. But that was before the cataclysm—the disruption that tore Calindor into its own demiplane.

The calamity had transformed them, fusing their individuality into a single hivemind and twisting their abilities. Now, they were identical in form but could shift appearances at will, adopting new guises with terrifying ease.

The Clandestine Insurgency Association—the CIA, as they were now known—had evolved into a force of chaos. Tales abounded: some claimed they existed to destabilize the natural order, while others insisted they infiltrated seats of power to amass wealth and influence. A darker rumor painted them as relentless hunters, driven to annihilate the only other creatures that share their clone-like existence, the Dorgles.

Dorgle’s breath caught. The word gnawed at him.

Before Dorgle could dive deeper into his discovery, Lullaby and Achroteth arrived. The group returned to the inn, each slipping into their own routines. Achroteth retired to his room, his only request a simple one: water, brought by Martha.

Downstairs, the tension between Dorgle and Martha simmered. Her patience for him, still frayed from past grievances, wore thin as he timidly attempted to order a drink. She wordlessly returned with fruit concentrate for Lullaby, cider for Rinji, and a grudgingly poured glass of water for Dorgle.

Meanwhile, upstairs, Achroteth worked diligently. Fabrics stretched across his workspace as he began crafting garments with the precision of an artisan. His focus wavered only when Rinji entered, book in hand, eager to discuss its tales.

Rinji spoke of mythical stories, his words tumbling out like a rushing stream. But it was the mention of the dragon gods that gave Achroteth pause. He lingered on a name: Serakar. The ancient syllables rolled through his mind, stirring a memory from a forgotten draconic dialect. "Skull," he murmured, the word heavy with meaning.

As the sun passed it's mid day peak, the inn’s quiet hum was broken by the toll of the town bell. The council meeting had ended, yet the sound carried a weight that pressed on the air.

For most, it was merely a signal marking the passage of time. But for Lullaby, the grumbling in his stomach hinted at something else.
