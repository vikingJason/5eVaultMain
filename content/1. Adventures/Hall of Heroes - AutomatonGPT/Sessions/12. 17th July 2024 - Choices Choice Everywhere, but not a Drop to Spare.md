Stoneday, 4th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE
 
Eagerly awaiting the effects of the potion he has just brewed, Achroteth starts to feel something happening. A strange awareness of his senses heightened, feeling every muscle fibre as they twitch with each movement, bringing a feeling of confidence to face any foe in combat, knowing that he would have the upper hand.
 
The same cannot be said for the Rum Gremlin, lying on the floor and uncontrollably twitching. Dorgle springs to action, pouring the viscera he had collected earlier into the Rum Gremlin's mouth. The results are not as expected; the poisoned Rum Gremlin's extremities become locked in place, and foam starts to bubble from his mouth. Cedric confirms that he is still alive, if barely.
 
The Rum Lord, seeing this as an attempt to eradicate the Rum Gremlins, requests a known cure to all that ails, Wheat Beer from the Troll's Toolbooth, as much as the party can carry.
 
Achroteth, acting as diplomat, tries to assure the Rum Lord that this is a big misunderstanding, a mistake, explaining that whoever developed the recipes in the book had obviously not done their due diligence.
 
The Rum Lord accepts that the party did not intentionally come to poison his den or that the people in town are not maliciously trying to hurt them, but asserts that it is further evidence that they are just careless.
 
This infuriates Achroteth, seeing this as an insult to himself and an affront to the Druids and their quest for the protection of the balance of the natural world.
 
A fight ensues, with Achroteth letting out a thunderous boom with his magic, the boom loud enough for the rest of the party to hear from their current locations.
 
During the fight, the Rum Lord wins a lucky break and sinks 2 broken bottles into Achroteth's skin, bringing him down and rendering him unconscious. The Rum Lord uses this opportunity for his potential gain, offering Dorgle a way out by agreeing to bring all the alcohol from the Troll's Tollbooth in exchange for letting him leave with Achroteth.
 
The defiant Dorgle declines the offer, to the pleasure of the Rum Lord who lets out a loud burp that echoes almost as loud as Achroteth's Thunder Wave.
 
Cedric appears back at the cave still disguised as Fawn, seeing his friends in trouble. The Rum Lord offers the "Princess" the same deal which Cedric accepts after hearing small, quick footsteps approaching from behind.
 
Lullaby, carrying Rinji, hurries through the cave to the source of the noises they heard moments ago.
 
Cedric and Dorgle carry Achroteth out of the Rum Den, Dorgle intimidating the Rum Lord by licking Rum Gremlin blood from his sword and causing a big ick for everyone.
 
The party, sans Fawn, all gather in the storeroom and start making preparations for their next move. Cedric heals Achrotheth and Rinji asks questions concerned about his brother. Achroteth and Lullaby collaborate on creating a healing potion from the ingredients at hand in the mediocre stocked storeroom.
 
At the Troll's Tollbooth, Fawn is greeted by a very proud Martha who has spared no effort for the menu tasting. Tables have been pushed together, white sheets covering them in place of more elegant tablecloths. Polished candelabras are lit to provide a more intimate ambience, a formal plate setting with multiple sets of cutlery arranged perfectly.
 
An elven barmaid with black pants and a white shirt appears the moment Fawn sits down to pour her some water, a five-star service not usually experienced at the tavern.
 
A nervous Galax emerges from the kitchen, donning a pristine chef's coat and hat with two plates in hand. He presents the options for the first course (Red course), a Scarlet Gazpacho with Chorizo Crumbles and Roasted Beet, and a Goat Cheese Salad, these are but humble options to honour the founders' resilience during harsh conditions.
 
Fawn decides that the vibrant gazpacho, with a nice depth of flavour, represents the rich harvest of Petalwood best for the first course.
 
Galax lets out a breath of relief and heads back to the kitchen as the server clears the plates from the table.
 
Galax returns with two options for a palette cleanser before the next course, Tangerine and Ginger Granita, and a Mandarin and Mint Sorbet.
 
Fawn can't help but choose the refreshing mandarin sorbet infused with fresh mint leaves to provide a crisp and clean palate.
 
Galax shows the smallest hint of a proud smile as he returns to the kitchen. The server comes to clear the table, evidence of the Gazpacho's deliciousness on the corner of her mouth.
 
Emerging again, Galax presents the options for the second course (Orange course). A Butternut Squash and Apple Soup with Duck Confit, and a Pumpkin and Carrot soup. Galax explains that it is customary for the bread on her plate to be broken in half to honour the spirits of those lost during the Blight.
 
Fawn decides that the creamy soup made from roasted pumpkin and carrots, garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds and a swirl of coconut cream is the right option.
 
The third course (Yellow course) options are presented, Lemon and Herb Quinoa Salad with Grilled Chicken, and a Saffron Risotto with Grilled Asparagus. A now confident Galax tells Fawn that for the third course, married couples will feed each other the first bite.
 
Fawns compliments Galax for his ability to not just make great food, but also to be able to handmake the Gnomish Foot Cheese that is sprinkled on top of the Creamy saffron-infused risotto served with grilled asparagus while selecting that as the option for the Yellow course.

The group in the cave formulate and execute their plan, they file confidently into the Rum Den and Rinji opens negotiations with the Rum Lord. The Rum Lord, not knowing who Rinji is, assumes the party are there to steal from them.
 
With no patience for diplomacy, Rinji's boasts cause a melee to break out, threats, quips and blows are traded back and forth.
 
---
 
Fawn is presented with Basil Lime Sorbet and a Cucumber Mint Refresher as another palette cleanser, choosing the sorbet made from fresh basil and lime that offers a cool and invigorating taste.
 
Galax, beaming with more confidence, presents the fourth course (Green course), a Herb-Crusted Glimmerfin, and a Grilled Zucchini and Bell Pepper Skewers.
 
The taste of the locally sourced Glimmerfin Fish fillet, herb-crusted and baked to perfection, served with a side of saut√©ed asparagus and a light lemon butter sauce is too much for Fawn to pass on.
 
---
 
The Rum Gremlins manage to disarm Dorgle who responds by driving an axe into the Gremlin's head.
 
---
 
Galax can be heard yelling at his staff as he comes out of the kitchen with his options for the fifth house (Blue course), a Blue Corn Polenta with Wild Mushroom Ragout, and Seared Scallops with Blueberry Gastrique.
 
Enjoying the bevy of local seafood, Fawn chooses the tender seared scallops drizzled with a tangy blueberry gastrique, served with a side of wild rice for this course.
 
---
 
The Rum Lord receiving a barrage of pain from the group looks woozy on his feet, more woozy than usual. Achroteth unleashes a fury of magic at his foe. Rinji exerts himself to deal some mighty blows.
 
The Rum Lord realises he has met his match takes out a bottle of alcohol with a rag, lights it and throws it at his feet. A fire erupts and as it engulfs those around him, the sprinkler system activates immediately negating the fire. The Rum Lords lets out a pained question, "When did we get those?" and falls to the floor defeated.
 
---
 
The anticipated sixth course (Violet course) is presented by a now relaxed Galax who has already removed his hat and unbuttoned his chef's coat, an Amethyst Lavender Tart, and a Blackberry and Violet Sorbet.
 
Fawn, already at her fill with sorbet, chooses the delicate tart filled with a rich lavender-infused custard, topped with fresh blackberries and a sprinkle of edible violet petals, served with a side of dairy-free vanilla bean ice cream.
 
Galax, pleased with how his menu has been received, heads back to the kitchen to continue his preparations.
