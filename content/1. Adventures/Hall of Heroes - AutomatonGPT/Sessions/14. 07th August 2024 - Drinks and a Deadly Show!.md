## Session Overview 
 
In the dead of night, [[Cedrick Deerfoot]], [[Fawn]] (currently in disguise) and [[Achroteth]] meet in the common room of [[The Troll's Tollbooth]]. Noticing [[Lullaby]] has not joined [[Cedrick Deerfoot]]  heads up to wake him from his slumber and join up with the others downstairs.

The ever hosptiable [[Martha]] assumes that [[Rinji]] and [[Dorgle]] must still be sleeping, however [[Achroteth]] is certain they had gotten too excited and left earlier than the others.

Knowing that [[Rinji]] would not have left without his weapons, he is able to use his magic to locate his brother through his item and track them through the forest. They follow the trail to a small shack, windows so grimly making it impossible to see clearly inside, the wooden boards  of the walls showing visible signs of wear and tear.

[[Cedrick Deerfoot]] picks the lock of the front door, gaining them access to the inside of the small abode and it appears that it has been abandoned for some time. A small bed and straw mattress have seen better days, a dusty rug splayed over the floor, a tall set of drawers and a bed side table with a candle holder and spilled wax are all that decorate the interior.

[[Achroteth]] searches for clues while [[Lullaby]] flips the rug to reveal a trap door that leads to a staircase diving down into a dark tunnel and on to large and sturdy wooden double doors. 

Knocking on the door, they convince the voice on the other side that they are there to meet their friends, a current memeber of the club [[Dorgle]] who will sponsor their membership, and to let them inside. The Bugbear security guard, E'Guard, eventually let's the group in, but warns them that he is going to keep an eye on them and doesn't want them causing the same sort of trouble [[Dorgle]] usually does.

They entered the second doors to a large arena, and a cacophony of shouts and screams of excitement.

The source of the entertainment coming from an enclosed pit, stone walls 20 feet tall. There are rows of stone benches surround the pit, providing a great vantage point for any spectator that wants to get up close to the action. Everyone here is currently going crazy, the clang of metal on metal becomes synonymous with cheers from the crowd.

It doesnâ€™t take much for the party to realise that the blood stained floor is actually a large grate, and obviously is part of a large drainage system.

They also notice an upstairs viewing platform, where it seems a lot more calm with the spectators dressed rather finely.

Looking for their friends proves difficult in the large crowd and they are ushered to the check in desk by a Red Cap tugging on [[Achroteth]]'s pant leg. 

They blonde woman sitting behind the desk explains that all visitors must sign a waiver form, standard boiler plate form to protect the venue in the event of any harm or death they may incur during their stay.

The group hesitate. Fawn, knowing that just signing a contract from a Fae can always have unintended consequences,  studies the form and the other's follow suit. [[Byll & Teadd]] show up and surprise the party. Still unsure of whether it is a good idea to sign their name to the form, they ask the pair of [[Neighbourhood Watch]] who instinctively signed the waivers .

The duo reveal that they love coming here because the drinks are cheaps. They share that the owner of the club is a Red Cap named [[Rorick]] who is always seen with a red waistcoat and a pocket watch, and does not like to be called "Redfang the Bloody" anymore. Their thirst getting the better of them, they hurry off for the cheap drinks at the bar, getting lost in the crowd.

Slightly re-assured, the each sign the form, either under aliases or their own name.
Fawn: Kyranth the Fierce
Achroteth: Druid
Cedric: Cedric
Lullaby: *draws a picture of a bird's foot*

They each pay the cover charge, negotiating the fee.

[[Cedrick Deerfoot]] asks about the hottest fighter on the line-up for tonight, the woman exclaims that [[Gnarl Bloodclaw]] is the current champion, and has been the champion for quite a long time. In fact betting on [[Gnarl Bloodclaw]] is pointless as the odds are 1:1.

Trying to entice the group to sign up as a participant, she then shares the rules for the fights:

- all fights are 1v1, unless it is an exhibition match (which pay extra to the winner and can be organised at request)  
- no outside help, there are wards to prevent magic being cast outside the arena to affect inside arena.
- there are three undercard classes of fighters, Rooky, Rascal , Reaper
- to progress through the ranks, you must win at least one fight.
- to challenge the champion you must have won at least one fight as a Reaper
- all fighters must wear a special armour that acts as a damage limiter, will not let a fighter get to 0hp, it will light up brightly and flash when this occurs.
- no tampering with any of the armour.

The Prize Money:
Rooky: 50cp
Rascal: 50sp
Reaper: 50gp
Champion: 200gp

This is not enough to entice any of them, so they check their weapons:
Fawn: Warhammer, Shield, Light Crossbow
Achroteth: small hunting knife, *convincing them the staff is a walking stick*
Cedric: Crossbow, Dagger, Sling
Lullaby: short bow, mace

They find another Red Cap going about his work duties and ask about the manager, learning that Rorick is in his office.  They ask about the upper balcony and are told that it is for VIPs only, and they by the looks of them they would be more comfortable dow stairs. The helpful Red Cap leaves and enters a door that says "staff only".

A booming voice is heard from the middle of the arena, [[Rorick]], carrying a small bull horn, announces the next fight will be starting soon and encourages the crowd to grab drinks from the bar and places their bets and the betting windows.

[[Fawn]] and [[Lullaby]] grab some seats near the fighting pit while [[Cedrick Deerfoot]] and [[Achroteth]] head to the bar. Deducing that the long line will mean a long wait, they engage in some awkward small talk. [[Cedrick Deerfoot]] tries to ask some questions from the [[Half-Orc]] bartender who bluntly responds that it is busy and he doesnt have time for chit chat. [[Cedrick Deerfoot]] unsure of what he wants is given an Ale and Achroteth  spots a delicious looking drink in an expensive looking bottle, a dark blue shimmerinh liquid with what looks like small stars floating through the night sky, and orders two shots of [[Starry Nights]]

The fight between the nervous [[Elysandra Windwhisper]] and the [[Giant Strider]] starts and it soon becomes clear to [[Achroteth]] that the fight is uneven, the Strider outclassing, and even toying with, [[Elysandra Windwhisper]]. The armor [[Elysandra Windwhisper]] lights up, signalling her defeat and the crowd stands up cheering, showing their pleasure at what they had just witnessed.

As the crowd settles the party try to spot anyone they may recognise and see some figures wearing green cloaks sitting up in the upper viewing platform but are unable to see their faces and work out who they are.

[[Achroteth]] excuses himself to the bathroom, locking himself in the only stall available and takes the form of a small spider.  Exploring the venue unnoticed, he sees [[Laundithas]], [[Felgan]] and two other Neighbourhood Watch amongst the wealthy looking individuals upstairs, but no one else out of the ordinary.

He returns to his seat just in time to see the next fight begin and reveals what he has learned. The next two fighters enter the arena and immediately start to put on an entertaining show of fighting prowess.

Some of the Red Caps nervously head to the edge of the pit, their heads hurried in a huddle and concern displayed across their faces and they discuss something that can't be heard over the noise of the crowd.

The fight continues, with each fighter trading blow for blow until one forecffully thrusts their sword through the belly of the other. They both stare at each other in disbelief as neither armor light up, the skewered fighter on the brink of imminent death falling to the floor as blood spills from the wound.

[[Achroteth]] jumps to action and flings himself into the pit, disregarding his own safety, immediately healing the fighter.

There is a moment of deathly silence in the large arena, before the crowd roars in a loud frenzy of excitement.

The Red Caps jump into the pit and approach the fighters, they carry off [[Achroteth]] and hzis patient, and the victor who is visibly in shock.
