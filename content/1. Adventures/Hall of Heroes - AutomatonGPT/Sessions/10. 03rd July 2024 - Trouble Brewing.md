**Waterday, 3rd Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
As Rinji opened the door to the underground club, Dorgle emerged, and the pair crossed paths with little regard for each other. 
 
Under the influence of one too many drinks, Cedric made his way unsteadily to the Automaton Housing Unit. His drunken antics, potentially attracting unwanted attention, raise internal alarm bells with Lullaby about Cedric's well-being and the trouble he might stir up. Recognizing the impending chaos, Lullaby enlisted the help of Achroteth, and together they hurried to intercept Cedric.
 
When they arrive at the Automaton Housing Unit, the party is surprised to find members of Neighbourhood Watch vigilantly assisting in protecting the AHU from unwanted visitors. Realizing the situation is more dire than first assumed, Achroteth convinces Cedric to abandon his quest and to ask for scraps of automatons as rewards for their help with the town. 
 
Meanwhile, Dorgle made his way to Petalwood. The serene surroundings of perfectly tended farms provided a momentary respite until he encountered the Automatons for the first time as they worked the fields on the outskirts of the village. This scene was unnerving, as glowing eyes stared back and replied in unison to his hail.
 
As he arrived at the tavern, his entrance at the Troll's Toolbooth was anything but quiet. Dorgle's heavy hand on the door made a statement, unfortunately not catching the attention of anyone inside until his second attempt.
 
Martha, ever the gracious host, assumed that Dorgle was with the party as they arrived back at the same time, so she kept the drinks flowing on their tab. Her generous libations helped ease the tension, though the atmosphere remained charged with anticipation.
 
Two members of the Neighbourhood Watch entered the tavern, their focus remained on the table with the adventures. Fawn’s attempts to engage with them were met with indifference until they finally left without saying a word.
 
**Stoneday, 4th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
With the dawn came new challenges. Martha sought the party's help in negotiating prices with the brewmaster, an endeavour she feels is necessary for the survivability of the Troll's Toolbooth.
 
The party headed to The Fermentary and proceeded with their negotiations with the brewmaster who revealed that Rum Gremlins had been pilfering from his vats. This revelation set the stage for the party's next task: confronting the mischievous culprits.
 
Their descent into the basement was met with an unexpected surprise. A sudden smash of a lantern threw them into darkness, heightening the sense of danger. Undeterred, the party’s search led to a hidden entrance. The discovery of a cave and tunnel system beneath the brewery hinted at deeper mysteries.
 
Their attempts to lure the creatures out from their hiding bears no fruit and they enter the tunnel. They find an underground cavern with a mysterious irrigation system from a pool of water inside the cave to overhead pipes with spouts at various intervals. As the adventures continued down into the depths of the tunnels, a locked door, 2 water jugs and a pedestal stood between them and the next chamber. Achroteth, made short work of the challenge, using his magic to create the right amount of water to fill the jugs and unlock the door and revealing the path forward.
