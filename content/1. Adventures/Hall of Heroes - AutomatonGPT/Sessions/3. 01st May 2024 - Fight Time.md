**Moonday, 32nd Of Solstis, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
While Cedric is still outside, waiting by the carriage, ever vigilant, the rest of the partyâ€”Achroteth, Fawn, Lullaby, and Rinji are caught up in a melee with Pip in his hideout.
 
Pip still has a few tricks up his sleeve and summons Living Shades to help him.
 
Not just inside his Pleasure Palace, but outside by the carriage as well.
 
With everyone fighting for their lives, Rinji is rendered paralyzed by his adversary.
 
Cedric convinces Butch and Cassidee to help him and they are able to summon the courage to join him on top of the carriage and help defeat the Shades.
 
A tough fight inside the building comes to an end with Fawn dealing the final blow and using new-found luminous powers.
 
Lullaby, unable to contain his child like inocence and wonder, jumps into the ballpit.
 
The party finds a stash of items and a pouch with some coins. As they load up to take them back to the carriage, Fawn finds a note written in a language that she can not read.
 
Thankfully, Lullaby is there, recognizes the Sylvan words, and agrees to translate the note when they are out of the building.
 
Achroteth, with a score to settle, orders everyone outside and sets the building alight; one would even say there was a smile and sense of satisfaction in his eyes as the building went up in flames.
 
The party returns to the carriage to witness Butch and Cassidee, with their new-found courage, engaging in some playful teasing of Cedric, who was afraid of his own shadow.
 
Lullaby translates the note for everyone - it's leaves a worried taste in everyone's mouth.
