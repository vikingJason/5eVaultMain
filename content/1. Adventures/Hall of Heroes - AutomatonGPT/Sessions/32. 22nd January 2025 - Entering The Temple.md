## Key Events

The party entered the wide courtyard with a shallow, reflecting pool at its centre. Statues of Sehanine, carved from moonstone, were scattered throughout. Many are broken, their elegant forms crumbled into moss-covered rubble. Others remained intact, their serene faces gazing upward as if in prayer.

A reflecting pool, broken and cracked, lay at the center of the courtyard. Its waters shimmer unnaturally under the eternal twilight sky, reflecting constellations that weren’t visible in the sky above.
 
Cedrick picked up moonstone and held it to the light, beams of moonlight refracted through the stone causing a lightshow. 
 
Will-o-Wisps awoke from the disruption and hovered around the reflecting pool, guarding it. Dorgle approached the reflecting pool and they seem to stop and observe the potential intruder. Lullaby almost stepped into the pool but Achroteth stopped them.

Intrigued by what this could all mean, Fawn begun searching and found some kind of riddle on the edge of the reflecting pool, “I fade in the sun, but thrive in the night. I guide the lost with my gentle light.”

Fawn and Lullaby deliberated, but Lullaby's responses go unnoticed by an enthralled Fawn. Achroteth, standing by the edge of the pool, offered the moon as an answer, and the doors opened.

In the large entrance, a letter with Lullaby’s name on it sat on the floor as if intentionally left there by someone who knew they would be there, but it was merely the E-mail from Dorgle to Lullaby that had finally been delivered. 

As they looked around the entranceway, magic lights illuminated the room to show it was covered in dust, untouched by anyone in centuries. The furniture that is there has been destroyed by time.

A long, narrow hall stretched before them, its walls polished to a mirror-like shine. The surfaces shimmered with magical illusions, showing fleeting images of loved ones, past regrets, or unrealized dreams.

Dorgle saw scenes of Byll and Teadd, the fight that revealed they were changelings.
Then it was a scene of Dorgle standing over the body of a slain Changeling in a room filled with large glass vats and science equipment.
Standing on top of a pile of slain Changelings, sword outstretched over head, screaming there will be only one. 
 
Cedrick saw his father sitting at his desk, working on something important. When Cedrick reached out to touch the goggles, his father slapped his hands away. 
A vision of Cedrick's ear pressed to a door, eavesdropping on a conversation between his father and others, talking about the Dawn of The Sun. 
His mentor Dorgle, training him in his early days of learning his tradecraft, spraying him with insults and telling him he is not good enough. 
His mother, baking him a special treat, scones with cream and jam. She offers the enticing baked goods to him, sucking him into the mirrored wall.

Fawn sees images of her mother, Queen Reeva, holding a royal court session but suddenly stop when she notices Fawn and dismisses everyone so that they can celebrate the princess' birthday.
She sees Ness, her lady in waiting, doting over her and looking with the same affection her mother does.
Next appears scenes in the library, moments with Celly over their shared love of books and the growing feelings of affection towards each other.
A vision of Sehanine appeared and embraced Fawn, with the same look of affection that the Queen, Ness and Celly splashed across her face. She held out her hand towards Fawn, much like the moment where she initially gifted the princess with the deific gifts. Fawn reached out to touch and a small pulse of arcane energy coursed through her, boosting her magical powers.

Achroteth made his way through the hall and saw memories of meeting Rinji for the first time and how their bond forged immediately at that moment.
The wall displayed a large feast with Achroteth's new family, while the Kobolds that took him in gathered the finest moss, they also showed their affection for the Dragonborn by preparing some of his favourite foods too.
The illusion faded into a scene of Achroteth's training at the Druid grove and the conversation he had with the Archdruid about the power that was within me. The Archdruid shifted it's gaze from the illusionary Achroteth and reached out to me with a strange knotted root in his hand but Achroteth refused to take it and continued through the room.

Lullaby saw his time travelling through the forest alone, hungry and lost, being trailed by Willow.
The reflecting wall showed Firbolg teaching Lullaby the ways of Eldath, rituals, prayers and how to harness the powers of the goddess.
The illusion swirled to reveal Lullaby in a large city where the sight of a small kobold caught their eye and set them off on an adventure with new found friends.
Next was a scene in a secluded area of an unfamiliar forest, Chumwell was in plain sight standing at an altar to Eldath, in a forgotten grotto with Willow guiding their prayers. Willow's attention turned to Lullaby and offered a leathered book case, arcane energy pulsed through the Kenku as they took the gift from Willow.

Achroteth, determined to learn the mysteries of the hallway, cast his incantation to detect magic and saw that the strong aura of powerful magic throughout the wall and flow through Lullaby as they touched the wall.

Dorgle suddenly raised his sword and struck the reflective wall, causing a wide crack and dulling the mirrored surface. In a fit of rage, Achroteth slapped Dorgle and absconded him for his disrespect of the sacred place.

---

Cedrick found himself surrounded by darkness, a strange darkness that enveloped everything. He reached out his hands to try and find a wall or door, some hope of escape still clutched to him. He breathed a sigh of relief as he his hands gripped a door handle, quickly opening it.

The bright light was momentarily blinding but as his eyes adjusted he saw hi friends standing before him in the hallway he had stood only moment earlier.

Although slightly confused, the party continued ahead into a room that looked like it was for storing items of importance. The walls were lined with shelves of various ancient scrolls, moon lit crystals, potions, and other religious relics and holy symbols.

Achroteth noticed that the crystals and a religious headdress glowed with magic and consulted with Fawn. She cautioned that taking these items to Brother Varrus may not be a wise choice.

The two doors leading out of this room split the party. Dorgle and Lullaby entered a room where the small cracks in the ceiling let the moonlight shine through, but whether it was coincidence or divine intervention, the moonbeams all focused on the same spot of the ground. Lullaby stepped onto the illuminated spot.

---

Achroteth, Cedrick and Fawn opened a door to a room where small alcoves ran along the walls to a door on the far end. The alcoves housed grand statues of elven warriors bathed in perpetual moonlight from large cracks in the ceiling above, each bore the mark of Sehanine.

As Cedrick moved closer to inspect one of the statues, the sound of grinding stone began to fill the chamber as the statues started to animate and turn to attack.

--- 

Whims of radiant energy started to swirl around Lullaby and Dorgle as spectral wolves suddenly appeared, surrounding them in the small room.

Dorgle and Lullady held their own facing the wolves, as Cedrick tried to wrestle himself free from the embrace of the stone guardians. Fawn appeared to not draw their attention at all and used the opportunity to hurl magic attacks at the foes.

Achroteth headed back into the hall of reflection and used his magic to start to mend the crack in the wall, but will it be enough to help his friends in time?



## Summary

Moonday, 8th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE 

The courtyard opened before them, a quiet ruin swallowed by the whispers of time. Once, it had been a place of worship, devotion carved in moonstone. Now, statues of Sehanine stood in solemn decay—some reduced to moss-laden rubble, others intact, their serene expressions lifted skyward as if in silent supplication. 

At the center lay the reflecting pool, cracked and broken, yet its waters remained impossibly clear, shimmering beneath the eternal twilight. The constellations it reflected did not match the sky above. A quiet lie, a whispered truth—one could never be sure which. 

Cedrick bent down, lifting a fragment of moonstone from the ground. He turned it in his fingers, and as it caught the light, a kaleidoscope of refracted beams spilled outward, dancing in the air like ephemeral fireflies. 

That was enough to wake them. 

The Will-o’-Wisps stirred from their slumber, drifting from the edges of the courtyard toward the pool. They did not attack, not yet. Instead, they hovered, watchful, their glow pulsing like slow, deliberate breaths. 

Dorgle approached the water, his boots crunching against stray pebbles, and the Wisps stilled. They were observing him, waiting. Lullaby stepped closer, perhaps to test the waters—perhaps to give in to something deeper—but Achroteth caught their arm, his grip firm. "Not yet," he murmured. 

Fawn, ever inquisitive, searched the ruins and found what had been waiting for them: a riddle etched into the stone at the pool’s edge. 

*"I fade in the sun, but thrive in the night. I guide the lost with my gentle light."* 

Fawn and Lullaby spoke in quiet deliberation, though Lullaby’s words drifted past Fawn’s ears, lost to her thoughts. Achroteth, watching the stars shimmer in the pool’s reflection, spoke without hesitation. 

“The moon.” 

And the doors opened. 

The ruin welcomed them in silence. The first thing they saw was a letter, crisp and deliberate, addressed to Lullaby. As if someone had known they would come. As if they had waited. But when the seal was broken, it was nothing more than the E-mail from Dorgle. 

The dust lay thick, untouched for centuries, but the reflections from the magic lanterns shimmered as if they had been watching forever. 

A hallway stretched ahead, narrow and glistening, its surface polished like a mirror. Yet it was not their own reflections they saw. 

---

Dorgle stopped first. His reflection twisted, shifting into memories—Byll and Teadd, their revelation as changelings; the moment he had stood over a fallen one, the weight of his sword pressing into his palm. 

The scene changed. A battlefield of slain changelings, his own body standing atop them, blade raised, mouth open in a cry of something—victory, grief, madness? The mirrored wall did not answer. 

---

Cedrick stepped closer, and the illusion shifted again. His father’s study, the familiar desk bathed in candlelight. His father, absorbed in his work, barely noticing the boy who reached for his goggles. When Cedrick’s fingers brushed the desk, his father slapped his hand away. 

The image rippled. Another scene: Cedrick, ear pressed to a door, listening to whispers of *The Dawn's Shadow*. 

The air grew thick. Another shift. Dorgle, in Cedrick’s early days of training, spitting insults with every failure, drilling lessons of worthlessness into him. 

Then the scent of scones. Warm, fresh, laced with cream and jam. His mother smiled as she held the plate out to him, an offering of love. He reached—and the wall pulled him in. 

---

Fawn gasped. The images now belonged to her. Queen Reeva, her mother, holding court with an effortless grace that commanded respect. But then her gaze fell upon Fawn, and in an instant, the session was dismissed. She rose, smiling, stepping forward. “Happy birthday, my love.” 

The illusion flickered. Ness appeared next, her lady-in-waiting, doting as always, devotion clear in every glance. 

Then Celly, in the library, two heads bowed over a book, fingers brushing pages—and, just once, each other. 

The image rippled, shifting into something more. Sehanine. The goddess embraced her, holding her the way a mother would, the way Ness did, the way Celly might. She extended a hand, a silent question. Fawn reached out. Power surged through her fingertips, a pulse of arcane energy searing into her bones.

---

Achroteth moved forward. He saw Rinji, the first moment they had met, a bond forged in an instant.

The wall shifted to a great feast, his new family of kobolds gathered around him, presenting him with their finest moss, with food prepared just for him. Affection, woven into the smallest of gestures. 

The vision darkened. His training at the druid grove, the Archdruid watching him with knowing eyes. A twisted root, knotted with ancient power, was offered. Achroteth hesitated. He refused. He walked on.

---

Lullaby’s past unfolded next. They saw themselves, wandering alone, starving, lost—until Willow. Until that first moment when they realized they were being followed. 

The wall shimmered, the images shifting. The Firbolg, teaching them the ways of Eldath. The prayers. The rituals. The power. Then, a city. A glimpse of a small kobold in the crowd, a chance meeting that became something more. 

Then a secluded grotto, forgotten by time. Chumwell stood at an altar to Eldath, Willow beside him, guiding his prayers. And then Willow turned, looking straight at Lullaby. She extended a leather-bound book, silent, expectant. Lullaby reached for it. A jolt of arcane energy rushed through them. 

---

Achroteth, pulse still thrumming with magic, murmured an incantation. The world shifted in his vision—arcane energy wove through the walls, flowing into Lullaby as they touched the mirror’s surface. The magic here was old, powerful. 

And then Dorgle raised his sword. 

The blade struck the reflection, shattering the illusion. A deep crack splintered through the mirror-like surface, and the light dulled, as if the ruin itself recoiled. 

Achroteth turned on him. His palm snapped against Dorgle’s cheek in a sharp, unforgiving slap. The silence that followed was heavy, laden with a tension that settled in their bones. The illusions had stopped. The ruin watched them now, waiting. 

---

Cedrick drifted in absolute blackness—a void so complete it felt like it swallowed even the idea of light. He reached out, fingers grasping for something—anything—solid. A wall? A handle? His breath came shallow, the weight of nothingness pressing against his skin. 

Then, his fingers brushed metal. A door. 

Relief surged through him as he turned the handle, light flooding his vision in a blinding flash. He staggered forward, blinking rapidly, and found himself exactly where he had been before—standing among his friends in the hallway. The same hallway. Had he ever left? Had he imagined it? 

The party exchanged glances, uncertain but resolute. They pressed on. 

The next chamber stretched wide and quiet, lined with towering shelves filled with forgotten history. Scrolls so old they might crumble at a touch. Crystals that pulsed with a gentle, moonlit glow. Vials of shimmering liquids. Artifacts of faith, of power, of gods now silent. 

Achroteth swept his gaze over the collection, his druidic senses tingling. The crystals hummed with latent magic, a religious headdress shimmering faintly in the dim light. He turned to Fawn and offered a suggestion of securing these holy items to take back to Brother Varuus.

Fawn hesitated, hands tightening at her sides, her voice was careful and shared that doing so might not be wise. 

Two doors. Two choices. Their paths diverged. Dorgle and Lullaby took one. Fawn, Cedrick, and Achroteth took the other. 

---

Dorgle and Lullaby stepped into a chamber bathed in thin streams of moonlight, silver shafts cutting through the darkness from the cracked ceiling above. At first, it seemed random—light spilling through wherever time and ruin had torn the stone apart.

But that wasn’t true.

Every sliver of light converged on a single point. 

A perfect circle of illumination, glowing softly on the stone floor. 

Lullaby stepped forward. Without hesitation. 

The moment their foot crossed the threshold, the air shifted. The silence, once empty, was now charged.

And then— 

They were not alone.

---

The other half of the party entered a room lined with shadowed alcoves, the air heavy with the weight of history. Statues stood in solemn rows, grand warriors carved from ancient stone. Each bore the mark of Sehanine, bathed in perpetual moonlight. 

Cedrick approached the nearest one, his steps careful, calculated. He reached out, fingers brushing the weathered surface of its shield. 

Then, the sound of grinding stone filled the chamber. 

First one. Then another. 

Statues turning. Moving. Watching. 

And then they attacked. 

---

Back in the moonlit chamber, spectral wolves materialized from the glowing air, their forms shifting between solid and ephemeral, snarls vibrating like echoes of a divine will. 

Dorgle stood his ground. Lullaby danced between them, magic curling at their fingertips. 

Meanwhile, Cedrick fought against the unbreakable grasp of living stone, the statues closing in, their movements slow but inexorable. 

Fawn, unnoticed by the guardians, wove spells of radiant energy, striking from the shadows. The warriors did not react to her at all. 

Achroteth turned back into the Hall of Reflection, back to the fractured mirror Dorgle had shattered. 

With a deep breath, he placed his hands on the crack and called upon his magic. Threads of healing energy pulsed through the stone. 

Would it be enough? 

Would it undo the damage? 

Would it save them? 

The answer had not yet come.
