## Key Events






## Summary

**Moonday, 8th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

I cast Mending for a 3rd time, fully fixing the wall and the temple’s defence retreat.

Cedric drinks one of the potions to heal.

Opening the door at the far end of the hall, there appeared to be a small blank room. Until Lullaby reached out and passed through the back wall into another room. Lullaby then ran their hand along the wall of the room, revealing a much larger room.

This is a large hall with time worn tapestries of the goddess. There are large beams of moonlight coming down across the room. Lullaby steps into the moonlight and the doors seem to move. The others step into the moonlight and then the corporeal form of a robes person appears.

“Travelers, I hope that you bear no ill to the goddess and her worshippers.”

“The moonstone belongs to the goddess and only those with her mark can take it”

The previous person who tried to take the moonstone has been imprisoned in the heart of the temple.”

Fawn moves closer to the person and they remove their hood to reveal an elven woman.

Elysandria is her name, she is the warden of the temple.

“The creature trapped in the temple is no longer a person, a shadow of their former self”

She then reveals the true door, which is ringed with arcane runes (that I scribe down) that Cedric determines they are to keep something sealed behind the door.

Fawn opens the door to reveal the ritual chamber we see within the moonstone and a shadow creature.

The altar is bathed in moonlight which is  bounced around the room via mirrors.

Fawn enters the room and begins to talk with the creature.

I remove my shirt and then once Fawn causes the fight to begin I activate my Starry Form and ready a Guiding Bolt.

As my light touches the 2 murals I feel empowered.

As the final mirror is aligned to the 3rd mirror the room is plunged into magical darkness.
