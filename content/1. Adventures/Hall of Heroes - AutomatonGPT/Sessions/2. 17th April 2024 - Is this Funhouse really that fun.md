**Moonday, 32nd Of Solstis, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
Our adventurers have just entered Pip's Pleasure Palace of Alliteration, except for Cedric, who gallantly stayed behind with the carriage to protect it and the content from any further danger.
 
Upon entering the funhouse, the party is greeted by a small foyer, lit only by candles that flicker and cast dancing shadows on the walls, even though there is no discernible breeze.
 
The path guides them through a maze of hallways that turn left and right, some taking them to an eventual dead end. Rinji takes the lead, fearless and confident he can take on any danger they face. As Rinji leads them through each turn, they are met with all sorts of surprises that both delight and infuriate: a patch of wallpaper that flakes off and is added to Rinji's possessions; a trap with a net that falls from the roof and covers Rinji in a gooey substance; strange puppets dressed as something sinsiter that drop down in a feeble attempt to scare the visitors; another booby trapped floor board that leaves Rinji covered in glitter. Finally they find a staircase that leads them upstairs.
 
Back at the cart, Cedric, on the lookout, hears the voice of Fawn calling out to him to come and help them because they have been hurt, but Cedric sees this as nothing but a ploy and stays put.
 
The rest of the party, now on the next floor, enters a room filled with countless mirrors that create a disorienting maze and no clear trail through to the next level. The mirrors are positioned in such a way that they show a room full of Pip surrounding them.
 
"I see you made it this far. good! It means you are either truly brave or truly foolish! Let's see if we can figure out which one it is! Answer these Riddles 3 and I reveal that path through."
 
As he steps back, the adventurers can only see their own reflection staring back at them, except for Fawn, who witnesses a serene and beautiful elven woman with silver hair and luminescent, moon-like eyes.
 
Pip asks his riddles, and with each correct answer, a path forward is revealed.
 
The princess continuing to seeing a stranger as her reflection is the mirror, puts her hand up to figure staring back at her and is branded with the symbol of Sehanine Moonbow (goddess of moonlight), elven god of death, dreams and heavens.
 
Once again at the cart, Cedric hear a child's laughter that slowly turns into a chilling sob but does not give in the obvious trickery.
 
As the party move up to the next level, they enter a room that seems to defy physics. With each step the walls become floors, the ceilings become walls, and furniture clings precariously to the "wrong" surfaces. This is not enough to stop our heroes who make their way through this room with ease and get to the door on the otherside. Pip is surprised by there progress and warns them, "I see you made it this far - but this room is for performers only!"
 
Defiantly Rinji opens the door to a room that is a chaotic mess of dusty costumes thrown about. Oversized rubber mallets covered in cobwebs and 5 ventriloquists dolls dressed up as spooky creatures sitting around the room awaiting repairs. The room suddenly goes dark for a split second, and the puppets are all in different positions.
 
Fawn Commands them to reveal themselves and the puppets remove their costumes.
 
As the puppets get closer, a fight ensues and the party defeat them.
 
Rinji kicks open the door to find a back room filled with a desk and chair. bookshelf and a large ball pit, but this is no ordinary playful ball pit, the balls are actually giant, deflated eyeballs. Hidden amongst the eyeballs are an array of stolen goods.
 
Rinji cautiously and confidently approaches the ball pit and Pip burst through, backflipping to the other side of the pit landing on a giant ball and juggling daggers while balancing, "Bravo! Bravo! You made it through my little obstacle course! Now. the grand finale"
