**Elday, 31st Of Solstis, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
A new day dawns in Calindor, and there is adventure on the horizon for an odd assortment of adventurers—they just don't know it yet!
 
Awakening in the Royal Tower of Calindor, Princess Fawniana Clarise Knoxcian Thramfear is getting ready for the day like any other.
 
Trying to pick an outfit is always tough with so many choices. Thankfully, her lady maid, Ness, arrives to pick an outfit and deliver a summons for Fawn to see Calarel, the Royal Archivist.
 
Not too far from the castle, Cedric Deerfoot has pulled an all-nighter tinkering with all manner of gadgets and gizmos in his workshop (the converted shed in his back yard). Alas he is still not able to return his father's goggles to a proper working condition. Cedric's mother, Lyra, returns from her job as a royal chef with a treat in her pocket for Cedric: a scone. These scones are not just Cedric's favorite, but Princess Fawn has also been known to sneak down to the kitchens early in the morning to pocket a few of these delicacies.
 
Lyra, knowing that her son is still troubled by the lack of progress, sends Cedric off to see Calarel, who will certainly be able to assist with information that will help him achieve his goals.
 
An odd combination of Dragonborn and Kobold, Achrotech and Rinji, are brothers that have come to Glitterfall in search of answers about the rune that Rinji has recently inherrited. Their quest for knowledge takes them all over Glitterfall, until eventually their path is pointed towards seeking out the royal archives.
 
Also out and about in the bustling streets of Glitterfall, Lullaby purchases some valuables from a local merchant without haggling, breaking The Rule of Hospitality, much to the dismay of the shopkeeper. The Wild Fae magic surges in the store and a choice is made that results in Lullaby shrinking down to half his size and the shop keeper growing to double theirs.
 
After leaving the store, an inquisitive Lullaby spots a curious pair (Achroteth and Rinji) as they make their way through the streets of Glitterfall and is so mesmerised that he decides to follow them.
 
As if by shear coincidence, or perhaps fate, these five adventures find themselves all waiting outside Calarel's office and enter the room together.
 
Calarel creates a stir when she tells Fawn that her mother has charged her with a Royal Assignment, to head to the town of Petalwood and report to Sheriff Elrohir. Elrohir recent reports have been troubling, with claims that local Fae are harrassing the towns folk which would be a serious breach of the peace accord that Queen Reeva and The Whispering Court signed.
 
Fawn, taken aback by this request at having to leave the safety and security of the castle, pleads to no avail to have Ness and Celaena accompany her but Calarel explains that the Queen has decreed that no from the Castle may accompany her.
 
Calarel does see an opportunity however to ensure the Princesses safety and emplores the others to accompany Fawn. In exchange Calarel agrees to provide information to Achroteth and Rinji, and Cedric, as well as gold, as soon as they return with the Princess.
 
Fawn sets off to start preparing for her trip while the rest of the party head down to where a black stage coach is waiting, supplies and provisions strapped tight. These carriage operators are Butch and Cassidee, a man with a leathered face and intense brown eyes and a younger woman with blonde hair hidden under a green hood and holding a crossbow.
 
Unsure of what to take, Fawn has packed 3 large chests to bring on the journey to prepare for any eventuality, but leaves it to Ness to carry them all downstairs.
 
When they arrive at the stables, Butch explains that there is only enough room for Fawn to take a backpack and her and Ness whittle it all down to only the most essential. Fawn makes sure though that she includes a rather prized possesion in her backpack, a book that she had just given her about Petalwood by Celeana when she heard the news of Fawn's nearing departure.
 
The journey at first was uneventful, with the travellers starting the process of getting to know each other.
 
 
**Moonday, 32nd Of Solstis, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
The second day also starts off rather uneventful and after a few hours of travelling, the heat of the midday Summer sun blasting on the walls of the carriage turns the cramped quarters almost into an oven. It is a welcome sign when sun starts to set and with it a cool breeze starts to blow through and provide some welcome relief.
 
The peaceful bliss is shattered though by a cacophony of off-key music coming from all around the stage coach. Suddenly a burst of smoke erupts on the road in front of the carriage, Butch pulling back on the reigns brings it to a jolting halt.
 
Standing on the road in front is a figure that resembles a stout human but with the furry lower bodies and cloven hooves of a goat and horns sprouting from their head. It's hard to miss that his face is haphazardly painted white with blue oversized lips and red diamonds around his eyes and he is clad in mismatched rags and a crooked jester's hat.
 
"Halt. travelers! You have stumbled upon the illustrious Pip's impromptu performance troupe! Prepare to be amazed… or terrified… mostly terrified!" he exclaims, and throws pebbles at the ground in front of them which explode in harmless puffs of smoke.
 
Pip summons creatures with the physical traits of a canine and with the magical essence of the fae to do his bidding before departing. The team valiantly defend the carriage and contents, without the help of a terrified Butch and Cassidee, but not before one of the Blink Dogs manages to escape with some of the provisions meant for Petalwood.
 
The carriage sets upon it's journey again until it meets a fork in the road that leads to an obvious hideout and discuss what they should do, eventually deciding that they should recover the stolen goods meant for Petalwood.
 
Following the path, the party stumbles upon a clearing dominated by a dilapidated multi-story funhouse. The funhouse stands as a decaying monument to forgotten merriment and the smell of stale popcorn lingers on the air. A walkway almost hidden by overgrown weeds leads to the main entrance, a gaping maw of a giant, toothy grinned Jester painted on the front and a large iridescent sign reading Pip's Pleasure Playhouse of Alliteration flickers in the night sky.
 
Fawn calls out, demanding that Pip come out and surrender himself and the property he stole, but receives no response. The group manage to break their way in, while Cedric takes the carriage back to fork in the road so that he can protect the remaining supplies. Entering the funhouse, Pip begins his taunting, "Welcome! Welcome! It has been years since Pip's Pleasure Playhouse of Alliteration has seen a willing living soul. Do enjoy yourselves and remember the number 1 rule - no one gets out of here alive!"
