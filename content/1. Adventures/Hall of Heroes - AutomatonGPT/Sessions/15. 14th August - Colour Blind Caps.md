## Session Overview 
 
Winding back the clock, [[Rinji]] and [[Dorgle]] wake up, anticipation and excitement getting the better of them, and make tracks without the rest of their friends heading straight to the Fight Club.

They quickly arrive at the unassuming shack, [[Dorgle]] quickly using the secret floor board to unlock the door and remove the rug, before being stopped at by the large double doors. [[E'Guard ]] begrudgingly let's them in, warning [[Dorgle]] that his usual antics are not welcome pointing to a sign on the wall that displays the word "Trouble" with a picture of [[Dorgle]] underneath.

Once inside, the smell of blood, sweat and cleaning chemicals fills their nostrils. A Red Cap fetches [[Dorgle]] his usual drink and they are ushered to the check in desk.

The woman behind the desk hands them both their check-in forms, [[Dorgle]] instinctively signing as "The Real Dorgle". [[Rinji]] takes a moment to read over the contract, happy yet unsure why the contract would include recipes suitable for a party.

Electing to become a fighter, [[Rinji]] pays the registration fee, negotiating it down from 20sp to 19sp.

The pair make their way to the Fighter's Lounge, discussing their disappointment that their new found bloodsport actively stops them from actually killing people. Standing in a large room with benches, lockers and a sparring ring, they observe their oppossing combatants. It quickly becomes obvious that the other fighters are avoiding a towering, muscular gnoll with mottled brown and black fur whose eyes gleam with a savage intelligence.

[[Rinji]] approaches the staunch figure and talks with [[Gnarl Bloodclaw]] the current champion of the arena. Tensions rise as the fighters  trade comments to either boost their own ego, or crush the other's.

[[Dorgle]] pulls out his flask filled with Rum Gremlin good, pretending to take a sip and letting a little of the bloodied liquid drip down his chin.

[[Gnarl Bloodclaw|Gnarl]] tring to laugh it off and maintain his tough posturing, shooes them away.

An official looking Red Cap with a clip board approaches [[Rinji]] and [[Dorgle]] to confirm how they would like to be introduced with the start of their fight, the long winded answers potentially too much for the Red Cap to concentrate on.

They study their opponents, [[Rinji]] focusing on [[Bax]], an portly human with a shaved head and a large club. [[Dorgle]] spotting a rather lean and nimble looking [[Vikarus]] standing too close to his son.

The next fight starts, [[Elysandra Windwhisper|Elysandra]] returning to the lounge looking obviously defeated physically and mentally by the [[Giant Strider]] shortly after.

They continue to mentally prepare for their bouts as the next fighters prepare and are announced. As the fight starts, several Red Caps start to enter the room with looks of concerns advertised on their faces. They notice for the first time, a silence briefly fills the stadium before an eruption of deafening cheers explodes from the crowd.

The Red Caps return to the lounge from the fighting pit carrying a fighter that looks more than just merely hurt. They are followed by [[Achroteth]] who is concerned and focused on the downed fighter. A slightly taller Red Cap wearing a waistcoat and pocket watch tail the group, immediately recognised by [[Dorgle]] as [[Rorick]] the owner of the Fight Club.

[[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] and [[Lullaby]] are requested to join their fellow adventurers in the Fighter's Lounge while [[Fawn]] looking like a pirate that has not seen a bath for many months is "accidentally" overlooked.

[[Rorick]] requests assistance from the group, asking them join him in his office. There he shares with the group, that he returned to his office from announcing the last fight to find a letter slipped under the door to his office threatening that a fighter would die in the next fight. He explains that as soon as he read the note he rushed to the arena but was too late to stop the fight.

Concerned for the implications to his source of sustenance for his fellow Red Caps, he implores the group to assist him find who is behind the dastardly act quickly.

The group question [[Rorick]] learning that the Quartermaster is responsible for the maintenance of the armor and all items in the Armory. He also shares that while there have been no guests or fighters that have been recently scorned, his assistant manager [[Raddicus]] has recently challenged him for ownership of the club, and his champion [[Gnarl Bloodclaw|Gnarl]] has recently expressed his dissatisfaction with the lack of quality fighters and aggressively demanding something be done to make it more interesting.

In desperation [[Rorick]] offers for [[Dorgle]] and [[Rinji]] to not have to progress through the individual tiers and can challenge [[Gnarl Bloodclaw]] as soon as they wish, however the pair elect to stick to their current line-up.

With [[Rinji]]'s fight comming up next, he and [[Dorgle]] head back to the Fighter's Lounge while [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] and [[Lullaby]] make their way to the Armory. [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] inspects the armor, looking for any clues as to what may have caused the malfunction. The armor, a product of [[ACME Inc.]] (Armor & Common Magical Equipment), has magical essence woven into the very fabric of the armor. The armor in question though has been tampered with, someone or something has dispelled the magic force of the armor.

[[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] questions the Quartermaster, who shares that he is the only person who handles the equipment, and when he is delivering the armor for each fight, the door is locked and a guard stands vigilantly at the door.

[[Lullaby]] heads out to interrogate the guard, he discovers that the Red Cap had left his post to ask a friend of his to go and place a bet on his behalf, a violation of [[Rorick]]'s rules. Pleading for mercy, the Red Cap is unable to sway [[Lullaby]] and makes a dash for the exit. [[Lullaby]] gives chase and Cedrick heads after them.

[[Lullaby]] tackles the attempted escape artist, grabbing his ankle and stopping him in his tracks. Catching up to them, [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] hog ties the Red Cap and they drag him to the Fighter's Lounge surprising [[Rorick]] who frantically waiting for the next fight to start. [[Rorick]]'s attitude changes when he learns that the guard had left his post and violated the house rules. The guard is subject to an intimidating interrogation by [[Rorick]] and spills details of his friend, well not really a friend, just someone with a "magnificent green cloak." 

[[Rinji]] heads to gate to the arena for his fight with [[Bax]], unsure of how to evaluate his opponent who has been nothing but sincere and polite. The fight ends as quickly as it begins with [[Rinji]] knocking out [[Bax]] in a single blow, this angers the already restless crowd and [[Rorick]] attempts to appease them by offering discounted drinks at the bar until the next match starts.

[[Raddicus]] absconds [[Rorick]] for the poor handling of the situation, and seizes an opportunity to satisfy his goals, asking [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] to follow him for a conversation away from prying ears. The group follow the assistant manager who eagerly reveals that he and a small contingent of other Red Caps are unhappy with current management and feels limited by [[Rorick]]'s short sightedness. He wants even more blood spilled to bring even more crowds to the arena, and more Red Caps.

[[Raddicus]] reveals he is unhappy that [[Rorick]] has dismissed the talks to provide the Automatons to work around the club, arguing that he has it on good authority that it will make it more efficient with getting the blood they need, and will reduce running costs while improving operational output. He knows that the club is not making as much as it could, the money is invested back into the people that work and fight there and keeping the cost of the drinks low, but dreams of how much more they can help the Fae if they had more money.

The source of his entrepreneurial insights have come from discussions with a very helpful and successful merchant who has helped him see the potential the club can make. When the group start asking questions about his whereabouts before the armor was sabotaged, [[Raddicus]] jumps to conclusions, assuming that they are insinuating that he had something to do with it he challenges them to ask any of the Red Caps in the staff room who will tell them that he was there the whole time talking to his merchant friend wearing a green cloak, [[Felgan]].

The group try to persuade [[Raddicus]] that [[Felgan]] can not be trusted, with [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] explaining that she has made an official complaint to the Council of [[Petalwood]]. This does not convince [[Raddicus]] of anything untoward, but if they can provide some proof it may be enough to sway him.

[[Rinji]] confidently boasts that the princess they are with has the complaint forms and will gladly share it, before [[Lullaby]] weaves his web of deception, hopefully fooling the Red Cap.

They head towards  [[Rorick]]'s office and pass a large enclosure where Red Cap named [[Rebeckna]] can be seen tending to some animals and monstrosities in  comfortable looking pens. Looking for a way to humiliate [[Gnarl Bloodclaw|Gnarl]], [[Dorgle]] learns that [[Rebeckna]] takes her duties seriously, feeding only wholesome, nutritious and organic food. [[Rinji]] is treated to a variety of moss that they been able to infuse with [[Fireleaf Spice]], but the spice is too much for the Kobold to handle.

In the manager's office, they try to convince the Red Cap that the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] must be involved in what happened, [[Lullaby]] sharing that their leader [[Irbaron]] has nothing but disdain for the Fae, but [[Rorick]] finds evidence lacking. To be safe, he asks them to bring [[Fawn]]'s journal and the complaint form while the Red Caps round up everyone wearing a green cloak...
