## Key Events

**Galeday, 2nd Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
The party awoke from a well-earned long rest to the gracious hospitality of Marth, the proprietor of the Troll's Tollbooth.
 
Butch and Cassedey, still at the table they were last seen at the previous evening, were the only patrons this morning.
 
Rinji, realising he was still covered in glitter, went for a "bath" in the Moonsong Lake, meeting locals, scaring the fish away, and discovering a star-shaped shiny yellow-tinged white gold-colored stone.
 
As the party prepared breakfast, they discussed the reports of "fae misdeeds" obtained from Mayor Finroth and deduced that whoever completed these reports did not put a lot of detail or effort into capturing all the relevant information, yet the reasons why are not yet clear.
 
Report:
1. Fae dressed as animals were attacking and killing livestock at a few of the farms around town - consortium of concerned farmers.
2. The local brewer has reported that he is pretty sure that Fae is stealing the alcohol he has been concocting - Llerman Rockmouse.
3. There are rumours that some Red Caps have set up a local underground fight club that has been going on for a while now - Felgan Daisyburg.
4. The local blacksmith has reported that Fae has been stealing all the metal ore that she uses in her smithy to make the tools for the town - Lerendrie Silkbal.
 
As the party set off to start investigating the farm attacks, without Cedric, who had not yet woken up from his slumber, the townspeople were in a stir after reports came through of animals attacking farms at that very moment.
 
Some of the townsfolk, already convinced that it was the Fae, could not stand up to Princess Fawn or Achroteth when their views were challenged.
 
Once they arrived at the farm, they saw some starved and scrawny wolves and a boar being held off by a couple of farmers trying to protect their sheep.
 
Through her divine senses, Fawn was able to detect that some form of enchanted magic was present and affecting these beasts.
 
Achroteth was able to communicate with the wolves, learning that they were sent to the village to find something to eat as the food sources in the forrest had become scarce over the past few months.
 
Achroteth, not wanting to hurt these poor hungry creatures, produced some good berries to satisfy their hunger in exchange for directions to Mother. The wolves, loyal to Mother, would not take them to Mother but did disclose that she lived in a cave that protected her great tree. The wolves left without any bloodshed.
 
The farmers thanked the group, but when questioned about what had happened and the report they filed, they were quick to blame Fae, convinced that there was no other explanation than Fae dressed as animals causing mischief, but going too far this time.
 
The party made their way quickly to the Bertram farm, but it was too late to protect the livestock there. Mistress Bertram was quite upset that her prized cows, Bessie and Dot, had been killed by a pack of hyenas.
 
The team learned that these hyenas didn't just kill these cows; they were also feeding on them. Rinji was able to track the hyenas through the forest to try and locate Mother's Den.
 
As they trekked deeper into the forrest, it was evident that trees were being cut down, but not enough to immediately cause concern.
 
Then, from the treetops, a shrewdness of apes appeared, one throwing a large rock down and, with Achroteth's quick thinking, was able to spectacularly whack the rock right back at them.
 
The ensuing fight was quick and easy, even when some shrubs woke up and joined the fray. The team pieced together the bloody wounds that the apes had already suffered in a recent scuffle.
 
These events have given our adventurers much to think about!
