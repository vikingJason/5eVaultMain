**Stoneday, 4th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
In the aftermath of the fight in the Rum Den, Rinji searches the body of the Rum Lord, finding an odd looking cup and some pages that look like they were torn from a ledger.
 
Cedric takes a moment to study the cup and causes a flurry of excitement from Lullaby when he learns that the cup can make water taste like any flavour of fruit juice, and as an added bonus, it causes the drink to fizz.
 
The group leaves the den with two Rum Gremlins as captives, and heads back upstairs to the brewmaster.
 
Surprising them, however, is not the brewmaster, but members of the Neighbourhood Watch who have been summoned after the loud and concerning noises from underneath The Fermentary. Achroteth is able to clarify that they are not working with the Fae, but rather have brought them to work for the Brewmaster in exchange for a share of the alcohol produced.
 
The Neighborhood Watch leaves, exclaiming that they will report their findings to Irbaron.
 
As the party leaves, Achroteth takes a moment to question the gremlins as to why they have resorted to stealing. The unapologetic Rum Gremlin exclaims that the Rum Lord had told them he did try to get help from The Whispering Court but had not yet been able to secure the assistance they needed, The Silent Adjudicators had sent correspondence that they would send help soon, but in the meantime, they should do what they must to survive.
 
The group leaves to meet up with Fawn at the Troll's Tollbooth, except for Achroteth, who splits off to have a quick word with Althea.
 
Althea is grateful, she tells Achroteth that she has heard the news that they have helped Llerwyn. Looking for answers, Achroteth explains that the Fae had resorted to stealing, and trying to make their own alcohol from an old notebook with no luck, and asks why the Whispering Court would leave the Rum Gremlins with no aide and let the Silent Adjudicators rally more to their cause.
 
This is concerning to Althea, she explains that the notebook must have been from the Apothecary but has not reported itlost or stolen. Althea also shows Achroteth a copy of the letter sent to the Rum Lords confirming that the Whispering Court is doing their best to help but have been hindered by the slow roll of the democratic process.
 
Lullaby, Cedric and Rinji, arrive back at the tavern to see that Fawn has been enjoying a delicious meal while they were dealing with the Rum Gremlins. Lullaby can't hide his disappointment and runs off to play in the river, even after Fawn tries to offer the remaining bit of dessert not yet cleared away.
 
Martha, seeing that the group have returned, offers them some refreshments and to have water drawn for a bath do they can clean themselves up. Sheepishly, when Martha learns the trouble the group have gone to help her, she admits that she has struck a deal with the Automaton Brewbot to supply the tavern with alcohol at the same price she had been paying and could not pass on that deal. As compensation, she offers to not charge anything towards the party's tab for the day.
 
Rinji, spotting the dwarf that had bested him in an arm wrestling contests nights earlier, heads over for a rematch. The stakes are raised, and the loser must buy a round of drinks. Rinji easily defeats the dwarf, showing Dorgle that he is worthy of entering the fight club.
 
Dorgle, and his new found shadow, boasting self confidence slams his sword into the floor of the tavern. This brings the scorn of Martha, unhappy with lack of respect Dorgle has showed her establishment and hospitality.
 
Rinji offers to assist pay for repairs and pays Martha what she quotes, without haggling - and as the money is exchanged a beautiful garland of flowers sprout from Rinji's face like a beard.
 
As the excitement dies down, Achroteth joins the party at the tavern and shortly after two members of the Neighbourhood Watch enter. The same two who had been a menacing presence the night before.
 
Byll and Teadd explain they have come with a request from the Council to join them at Town Hall.
 
Byll and Teadd, happy to chat as they make their way through town, answer Fawns questions about their living situations.
 
Achroteth sends a messenger bird to Cedric who is still enjoying a nice hot bath, to let them know where they are. As the bird leaves, it's drops an unexpected "present" in the bath and flies off.
 
The council are in session, with Irbaron again taking place of Sheriff Elrohir who has still not returned. A heated debate takes place, as Finroth listens to the details of the party. Irbaron is unwilling to concede that the Fae are not responsible for the stealing and that they should be arrested and tried for their crimes.
 
The conversation becomes tense as accusations are flung back at the Council by Fawn and Acroteth. Accusing the town of prejudice against the Fae and that they need to be doing more to help the more vulnerable citizens.
 
Finroth thanks the group for their interesting points and acknowledges that they have given the council much to deliberate on.
 
The adventurers head back to the Troll's Tollbooth, and decide that the next course of action is to head to the Fight Club. As they enjoy some drinks, Fawn looks to Martha for some ingredients to color her hair and secures some coal.
 
Lullaby eagerly helps Fawn create a plausible disguise, Fawn now resembling a younger version of her mother during her days of piracy.
 
Realising that it has been an exhausting day already, they hunker down for along afternoon nap.
 
Achrotheth consults the natural forces of the universe, looking for guidance that he is making a difference and bringing back the balance and receives some slight comfort.
 
Dorgle is awoken by a set of eyes staring at him through the window. As he races out of the bed to investigate, the creature retreats through the darkness, not before Dorgle gets a glimpse of a gaunt, humanoid creature with slick, gray skin that looks like wet clay. Continuing to track the creature, it moves through shadows and a humanoid emerges, wearing a green cloak of the Neighbourhood Watch, Dorgle is certain it is either Byll or Teadd.
 
Fawn awakens to a bright blinding ray of moonlight shining through the window in her room. She hears a voice in her head who explains that it is Sehanine, and that Fawn has been chosen to recieve the gifts and blessings of Sehanine because of her fight to protect those unable to protect themselves. Fawn must continue her cause, fight for justice and continue to pray.
 
After the conversation Fawns goes back to sleep and awakens to find a vision of the figure she saw in Pip's playhouse. The figure says nothing, communicating through gestures and head movements. The figure walks towards the window and vanishes in the moonlight.
 
After the long rest, the party make their preparations to head to fight club, Fawn again using the charcoal to color her hair and disguise herself.
