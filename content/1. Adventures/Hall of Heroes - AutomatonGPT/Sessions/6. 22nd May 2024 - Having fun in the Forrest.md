**Galeday, 2nd Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
While standing over the bodies of dead apes, Rinji, Fawn, Lullaby and Achroteth are pleasantly surprised by a panting and weezing Cedric who finally caught up to his pals after sleeping in that morning 
 
Rinji picks up the tracks of the hyenas there were chasing and they lead the party to a stream that is showing signs of unknown forces impacting the natural resource.
 
The stream trails through the forrest towards a clearing and a cave, one slight problem the cave entrance was inhabited by a large sleeping bear.
 
What a predicament!
 
The party tried different ways to get passed the bear, to varying degrees of success.
 
Lullaby showed off his impressive vocal range, imitating a bears roar and waking up the sleeping sentry.
 
Fawn's quick thinking kicked into gear and she lit up a pinecone that she found as a shiny lure to temp the bear away from the cave, and it did work ... at luring Lullaby away, chasing after it.
 
Achrotheth was able to charm the bear, creating a bond so that he would not be treated with aggression as he made his way through.
 
During their schemes, the bear let out a roar, that was soon followed by a loud shrill squeal like noise that echoed from within the cave, causing a stir amongst the forrest creatures.
 
Realising that he compatriots were not going to be able to easily get passed the guardian Achroteth found an alternate path to a secondary entrance. Rinji lead the party through the cave, ever vigilant and spotting potentil traps.
 
But they were not alone in the cave. Beasts in front of them, beasts behind them, the party were in a real bind. They were able to deal with the wolves, bears and panthers that attacked, both fataly and non-lethally.
 
Rinji snuck away and found a large grotto with a single majestic tree, the leaves glow and shimmer with hues of blue, purple and pink, bright enough to illuminates the grotto.
 
But that shimmer is wavering and leaves one by one are falling and gathering around the base of the tree.
 
Rinji heads back to tell the team what he has found, and when they get back, an alluring humanoid form is standing there, it is impossoble to tell if it is just covered in the leaves or if the leaves are a part of their skin.
 
This creature investigates the tree with a soft grace, slow moving arms reach out to touch the leaves, a hand placed delicately on the bark as if the creature listens for a heartbeat.
 
Achroteth stands forward to talk this creature, how will the creature react?
