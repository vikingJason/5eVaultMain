**Galeday, 2nd Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
We open the session with Finroth spotting a beak peaking out from the bushes to the side of the path. Lullaby uses his innocent charm to distract the mayor in conversation, putting him in an awkward spot of trying to be hospitable to the visitors of Petalwood and keep up with his mayoral duties.
 
This distraction buys Achrotheth and Cedric enough time to carefully retrieve an Automaton Power Crystal from the open chest unit of an automaton undergoing some maintenance, not triggering the obvious security measures.
 
They slip out, meet up with the rest of the party and make their way to The Troll's Tollbooth, using the back-door for a more subtle entry.
 
Martha, being the hospitable publican, spots the guests and offers them a nightcap to take with them upstairs. While waiting for her tea and Lullaby's juice, Fawn over hears a conversation at the table of an Elven farmer suddenly go quiet when one of them mentions Red Caps. This silence lasts only moments as they go back to their laughing and conversing about the days labours.
 
With drinks in hand Fawn heads to Cedric's room, where the party has setup for Cedric to use his tinkering tools and identify the crystal. From his ritualistic tinkering, he learns that the crystal contains a custom and power magic within, this magic creates an internal self sustaining energy force. It is also learned that the crystal shell that houses the magical contents is quite unstable and tampering with or damaging it may have catastrophic consequences.
 
After this discovery, the party retire for a sleep - it's been a long day.
 
**Waterday, 3rd Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
The party awake and are ambushed by Martha who wants to make sure the adventures are well fed before heading out for the day. During breakfast Martha delivers an E(nchanted)mail to Fawn from Ness asking about the details of the Royal Gala that Fawn held, what dress did she wear, what did they eat etc.
 
Casting her mind back to her Royal Training and Preparation Classes and remembers Lessons of Royal Etiquette and Decorum 34, Subsection a. - A member of the Royal Family, while on official duties or visiting a settlement in an official capacity, must host a formal dinner (or locationional customary meal) for the esteemed members of said settlement.
 
The Royal Member must choose the appropriate food, guests and entertainment, in line with local customs as not to offend the people, service and hospitality of the settlement.
 
Realising that she has made no plans to host such an event, Fawn enquires with Martha about hosting the event at the Troll's Tollbooth - to which Martha is of course more than happy to oblige, once the proper approvals have been granted.
 
The party set off, spotting Althea outside on the other side of the street, as to remain inconspicuous. Althea informs the group that Finroth and the Council have started investigating a break in of the Automaton Housing Unit and the theft of proprietary property from within the AHU. Thankfully this has not yet roused any suspicion, but the Nightwatch are assisting with looking into this with the Sheriff currently on duties out of town.
 
Althea, is also pleased to share that farmers have put feeding stations just outside their farms to help deal with the hungry beasts and prevented any further attacks on livestock.
 
Fawn makes further enquiries about hosting a royal dinner, her frustration with being bogged down by beauracratic red tape starting to bubble to the surface or her usual serene disposition.
 
The adventurers quickly head to Townhall where Fawn is able to requisition the appropriate permits application forms from Glendelle.
 
Seeing an opportunity to assist his cause, Finroth calls the party into the chamber of the Council and enquires with Lullaby about the break in. Despite Finroth's repeated questions about anything or anyone seeming suspicious around the Automaton Housing Unit, Lullaby commits to revealing nothing.
 
Realising he is getting nowhere, Finroth turns the conversation to the matter of an invoice he received from Martha. While acknowledging that he did and the town have offered to cover the cost of their stay, he pleads for the party to hone in their spending, reducing their per diem to only 1sp per day.
 
Executing her royal authority, Fawn negotiates this to 6sp per day, which Finroth accepts.
 
As the group are set to leave Townhall, their exit is interrupted by the entrance of a self important caped figure who rushes past them.
 
They head into the forrest to investigate the over extraction of resources, quite aware that they have an escort watching their every move.
 
The trek through the forest is uneventful until they hear a loud buzzing sound from deeper into the forest, Cedric quickly recognises that it is mechanical and not natural at all. They carefully move towards the source of the sound and see desolation.
 
20 Automatons with saws and axes, a large Automaton with a circular saw arm, are working methodically in this lumber camp clearing trees. The deforestation area is quite expa sive and concerning, setting off Achroteth and Lullaby.
 
As they approach looking for answers, a foreman with a white hard hat blows his whistle and all Automatons immediately stop work.
 
The foreman bot shows his permit signed and approved by the council that shows they are working within the boundaries of the permit and practice sustainable logging. Not satisfied with this, the Automaton is questioned further and explains that their owner is Motalon, a local timber merchant.
 
They party hurridly return to Petalwood, locate Motalon's manor and proceed to question this merchant.
 
He invites them inside to discuss, but the group having no time for pleasantries, decline the invitation. Motalon explains that his automatons are working within the bounds of the permit that was approved by the council.
 
Certain that Motalon is not consciously trying to deceive, hurt or cheat anyone Achrotheth leads Fawn to Townhall to put an immediate stop to the over working of the land while Cedric and Lullaby wait for the old merchant to get himself ready.
 
Back at townhall, Fawn and Achroteth are surprised by the caped figure from earlier sitting at the council table. He proudly boasts that he is certain it was Fey the broke into the Automatons Housing Unit, but this is quickly hushed by Finroth.
 
Finroth apologises for Irbaron, who is merely helping the council as commander of the local neighbourhood watch in Sheriff Elrohir's absence.
 
Fawn flawlessly executes her royal training and firmly dismisses Irbaron, who tries and fails to go toe to toe with Fawn.
 
Achrotheth's anger growing, demands the Council review the current logging permit. As they discuss, Finroth exclaims that the area the party have described, is more than double the size that should have been logged and that this must be a loophole in the wording that has allowed the Automatons to work outside the prescribed confines.
 
Finroth and the Council immediately hold an emergency session to discuss the wording of the permit, not confident in a speedy outcome Achrotheth Wild Shapes into a stallion and rides towards the lumber camp with Cedric and Motalon in their effort to stop this as thr council debate.
 
Fawn and Lullaby listen in to thr councils session as they discuss and vote on: 

1. What to call the session.
2. How to word the prescribed area on the permit. After hearing the options discussed, Fawn influences them towards the option prented which she is sure covers and closes all potential loopholes, which wins the support and vote of the Council.
3. How long should all logging operations stop to allow the forrest to recover. This comes down to an interesting conversation as they weigh what is best for the environment and what is best for the economic prosperity of Petalwood. Ultimately the council votes for all logging operations to cease for 3 months.
 
Once the votes are in the permit is updated and signed off by the Council.
 
Achrotheth, Motalon and Cedric arrive at the lumber camp in time to hear the foreman's loud whistle being blown again, and the Automatons packing up their camp. Motalon is quite confused by this, but the Forebot shows him the permit that has just been updated - so no logging will occur for the next 3 months.
