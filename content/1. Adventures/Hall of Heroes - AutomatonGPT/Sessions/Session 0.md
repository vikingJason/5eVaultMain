Welcome back to Calindor!

Many of the inhabitants of this realm quite clearly remember what life was like thirty-two years ago, when Calindor was a fractured land, still reeling from the iron fist of the tyrant Thunderhead. It was a time of strife, whispers of rebellion echoing through the ravaged city-states. Then, a phoenix rose from the ashes – Queen Reeva, a fiery revolutionary who rallied the fractured Houses and drove back the darkness.

Peace, when it finally arrived, was a balm, but a fragile one. Reeva, our stoic Queen, shouldered the weight of a thousand burdens after her coronation. First and foremost was how to mend the wounds left by Thunderhead's loyalists, their hearts still harbouring whispers of dissent? In the same spirit of compassion that her mother ruled with, Reeva re-opened the Court of Reconciliation, a decision many counselled was fraught with risk yet yielded inspiring results as the remaining forces loyal to Thunderhead either laid down their arms, or swore fealty to Reeva.

The coffers of the city-states bled dry, the scars of war a constant reminder of the trials they endured, Queen Reeva spared no expense and invested all of Calindor's resources into rebuilding after the tyrannical rule of Thunderhead and the destruction he left in his wake, fostering the trust and loyalty of the population, however rumours can still be heard to this day that high ranking military advisors and officers were unhappy with the decision as it had left the kingdom vulnerable to external or internal threats.

A brilliant but eccentric scholar claimed to have discovered a way to rid Calindor of the changing colours of the night sky. Reeva gave support to this scholar's research, their arrogance led to them taking shortcuts in their work and performed the ritual that they had uncovered without the proper preparations,  unleashing an unpredictable force that shifted Calindor to a new demiplane caught between the Feywilds and the Material Plane, severing the bond between the resident fey and the plane of Faerie and perverting the magical laws that shaped the realm.

**The Rule of Hospitality:**  Instead of genuine hospitality, anyone entering a dwelling must participate in endless, nightmarish entertainment for their "host." This could involve playing deadly games, enduring humiliating performances, or facing bizarre challenges with no hope of escape.
**The Rule of Ownership:** Everyone is expected to barter, to lie, cheat or even steal to get more than what they pay for
**The Rule of Reciprocity:** The concept of "gift" is replaced by a constant cycle of debt and obligation. Favors are expected to be repaid with interest, creating a system of manipulation and control

(Anyone not following the rules will start to suffer levels of exhaustion or role on a [[Wild Fey Magic Surge Table]])

And most contentious the decision of all, should Calindor embrace a new dawn, a system of rule unheard of – democracy? This has been rolled out on a small scale, with local villages moving towards the system of government where their leaders are elected rather than appointed by some special right. This move has seen outcomes that were predicted and others that weren't. There was an immediate reduction in reported corruption from the villages far from the capitals, citizens feeling they have a stake in their day to day lives lead to a greater social stability and an increase in productivity, especially in the gathering and processing of raw materials.

But this era of progress did not last as long when just over a decade ago, a virulent plague swept across the land, decimating much of the working class and wreaking havoc on the growing prosperity of the kingdom, causing a lockdown of borders between realms and strict curfews. Trade slowed to a halt due to fear, livestock and crops were left to rot with no one to tend to them and crime was on the rise. It was Reeva's crucible, her greatest test. With unwavering resolve, she forged a pact with [[The Whispering Court]] who agreed to provisions for the Fey creatures of the Wildlands to help work the lands in exchange for fairer compensation for their work and freedom of travel between Calindor and the rest of the Feywilds. This bargain, however, was a source of much debate amongst the population.

This is the tapestry upon which your own tale begins.  Will the choices you make will echo through the realm, shaping the destiny of Calindor itself? The answer, as always, lies in the adventure ahead and the choices you make.
