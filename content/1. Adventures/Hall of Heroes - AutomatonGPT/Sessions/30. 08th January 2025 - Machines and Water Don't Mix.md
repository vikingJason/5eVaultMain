## Session Overview 
 
**Moonday, 8th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

With the ferocious looking creature approaching them, tentacles whicking back and forth, Lullaby threw some rations at it in an attempt to appease it.

Rinji took advantage of the opportunity to  wrestle the infected Owlbear, fulfilling part of his destiny.

The infected Owlbear howled, sending Achroteth into a frightened state.

The Owlbear was taken down, and in it's dying breath it spit more of the Sarcovi parasites at everyone, but they were not able to burrow through anyone's skin.

Rinji cut the Owlbears head off and wore it around his chest like a trophy. Dorgle scooped up one of the parasites into his water skin.

As they continue forward towards the source of the booming mechanised sound, a long grated metal bridge crossing a section of flowing water awaited them. Passing over the bridge, looking into the rushing water, they see a trio of crystal topped pillars that appear deactivated.

Achroteth and Lullaby cautiously made their way across the bridge, hand pressed into the wall providing a sense of reassurance. Achroteth and Lullaby gazed around the large room, a large machine adorned with gears and a small crystal stood on one side of the room against the wall, while tools and Automaton parts were scattered around the floor.

Achroteth moved straight to the control panel of the water purifying contraption, trying to figure out what has gone wrong and how to fix it. As he inspected every inch of the inner workings of the machine he noticed that one of the gears was out of place, but also showed indications of sabotage. The power crystal also was depleted, it showed internal cracks and fissures.

Achroteth grabbed his leatherworking tools to try and fix the water purifier, but they were not suitable for the job. He then turned to his magic, using a spell to mend the broken gear, but they still needed a way to power the machine.

Lullaby checked the destroyed Automatons for their cores, but fear and confusion washed over the Cleric as he saw that someone, or something, had clawed through the chest of the constructs and taken the power crystals. Lullaby selflessly reached into his bag and gave Achroteth one of the small crystals he was given by the Quicklings. Achroteth used his Breath Weapon to recharge it.

With the crystal charged, Achroteth placed the crystal into the slot and immediately the gears started turning again, humming in perfect harmony. 

Dorgle and Rinji scavenged amongst the scattered Automaton pieces, and finding nothing interesting they started to make their way back over the bridge. As the party crossed, they were struck with relief to see the water purifiers had been reactivated  and working perfectly. 

But it was not all perfect, as Rinji spotted something in the water that was out of place, an insectoid looking corpse.

Dorgle jumped into the river with a rope in hand, securing it around the creature so they could pull it out of the water.

They stood in horror and curiosity at the grotesque corpse, not sure what to make of it. Achroteth's eyes widened as he remembered that this was a Meenlock, a deformed fae that originated from intense fear. He shared that they had no purpose other than to destroy good and beauty, and resorted to telepathic torture in order to terrify and corrupt other creatures. Anyone who succumbed to this torture would then be magically transformed into a Meenlock as well.

The group agreed that the infected body needed to be burned to stop the spread of the parasites. Dorgle wanted to show off his newly gained arcane powers and a flames shot forth from his outstretched fingertips. Among the flames, a burst of Wild Fae Magic surged and as the fire subsided, a Drow stood where Dorgle once had.

After a few moments of confusion, it was clear to all that Dorgle's tomfoolery had resulted in Dorgle now magically taking the appearance of a Drow.

The party headed back to town hall, while Rinji took a small detour to see Sylvaen. The apothecary confirmed that she could produce the potion Rinji required but she needed help with sourcing the final ingredient,  a crystalised kobold scale. If that proved too difficult to find, then a crystalised dragon scale could work. And if that was impossible, then Fey Nectar was always a possibility.

At town hall, Achroteth, Lullaby and Dorgle explained to Mayor Finroth that they had repaired the Water Purifiers. Dorgle was confident that he had Finroth fooled with his new disguise, until as they left Finroth said, "Goodbye  Dorgle."




### Session Notes
The infected owlbear lurched forward, its tentacles writhing in frantic, unnatural movements, slick with some foul ichor. It was a creature of madness, and madness could not be reasoned with. Yet Lullaby, their heart always leaning toward mercy, fumbled in their pack and hurled a handful of rations at the beast, hoping perhaps to placate it. The food fell at the creature's feet, unnoticed and ignored.

Rinji seized the moment, a fire igniting in his eyes. This wasn’t just a fight—it was something more. A stepping stone toward the destiny that had been whispered in dreams and etched into his soul. With a battle cry that echoed through the tunnels, he launched himself at the owlbear, grappling the abomination with all the strength his slender frame could muster.

The beast howled, a sound that struck the air like a shard of ice, and Achroteth stumbled, fear overtaking him for a moment as his limbs refused to obey.

The battle ended in a brutal crescendo. With a final, shuddering breath, the owlbear fell, its grotesque body collapsing into the grime of the tunnel floor. But death had not dulled its malice. As its lungs emptied for the last time, it spat forth a swarm of wriggling parasites—the Sarcovi—that clattered against armor and skin but failed to penetrate. Their vile forms lay twitching, defeated but not forgotten.

Rinji, chest heaving, stepped forward and brought his blade down in a clean arc, severing the beast's head. He slung it across his chest, its grotesque visage hanging like a trophy—a grim reminder of his triumph. Dorgle, meanwhile, crouched and scooped one of the parasites into his waterskin, the spark of curiosity glinting in his eyes.

The group pressed onward, drawn by the relentless booming of mechanized sounds ahead. The tunnel opened into a cavernous chamber dominated by a grated metal bridge spanning rushing water. The bridge groaned under their weight as they crossed, the sound blending with the roar of the current below. Glancing down, they caught sight of three crystalline pillars standing amidst the water, their faint glow long extinguished.

Achroteth and Lullaby led the way across the bridge, hands brushing the wall as if its solid presence could anchor them in the face of the unknown. On the far side, the room expanded into chaos: Automaton parts littered the floor, scattered among tools and shards of broken machinery. Against the far wall, a water purifier loomed, a massive construct of gears and crystal.

Achroteth approached the machine, his sharp, analytical gaze cataloguing every detail. He knelt to examine the gears, running his clawed fingers over the mechanisms. One of the gears was out of place, a subtle shift that spoke not just of an accident, but of sabotage as well. The power crystal, housed within a delicate framework, was a ruin of cracks and fractures.

He pulled out his leatherworking tools, improvising as best he could, but the precision required was beyond them. Frustrated but undeterred, he called upon his magic, whispering words that carried the resonance of dragons. A soft glow enveloped the broken gear, mending it with a pulse of arcane energy. Yet the purifier remained lifeless; it needed power.

Lullaby, their brow furrowed in concern, searched the wreckage of the Automaton parts for intact power cores. What they found chilled them—a pattern of deep claw marks carved through the constructs, as if someone, or something, had violently ripped the crystals free. They reached into their bag and retrieved one of the small crystals the Quicklings had given them. They offered it to Achroteth, hands trembling only slightly.

Achroteth accepted it with a nod, and with a sharp inhale, he summoned the raw power within his chest. His Breath Weapon burst forth, a concentrated surge of energy that lit the crystal from within. Charged and glowing, the crystal slid into place, and the machine roared to life. Gears turned in perfect harmony, the purifier resuming its sacred duty.

While the others celebrated, Rinji’s sharp eyes caught something in the water below—an insectoid corpse, its grotesque form drifting in the current. Dorgle, never one to hesitate, dove into the river with a rope. He secured the body, and together they hauled it onto the shore. What they revealed made their stomachs churn. The creature was deformed, its features twisted by fear itself. Achroteth paled as recognition dawned.

“A Meenlock,” he whispered, his voice thick with dread. “Born from terror. It has no purpose but to destroy beauty, to spread despair. Its touch, its thoughts—they corrupt, twisting others into more of its kind.”

The group debated briefly but agreed the creature had to be destroyed. Dorgle stepped forward, eager to prove his newfound power. Flames erupted from his hands, consuming the corpse. But with the fire came something else—a surge of Wild Fae Magic that crackled through the air. As the flames died, Dorgle stood transformed, his features now those of a Drow. For a long moment, silence hung heavy, and then replaced by a surreal acceptance of their companion’s folly.

Returning to town, Rinji took a detour to visit Sylvaen. The apothecary greeted him with a knowing look, explaining that she could complete the potion he sought but required a crystallized kobold scale—or, if necessary, a dragon scale or Fey Nectar. The weight of the task settled over Rinji like a shadow.

At town hall, Achroteth, Lullaby, and the newly Drowish Dorgle reported their success to Mayor Finroth. Dorgle, confident in his disguise, flashed a triumphant grin. But as they turned to leave, the Mayor’s voice stopped him cold.

“Goodbye, Dorgle,” Finroth said, the faintest trace of amusement coloring his tone.
