**Lumday, 1st Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880**
 
The band of adventurers travels throughout the evening and draws near their destination, Petalwood, Butch slows the horses and carriage to a gentle trot. The group notices the farms on the outskirts of town—not just any ordinary farms; these are textbook farms, well maintained and lush, with crops perfectly symmetrical and spaced equally apart. Even the fertiliser smells sweet and perfect.
 
The sounds of sheep and cattle draw attention to pastures where farm animals are grazing without a care in the world. They look happy, and the party is certain that they are smiling back at them.
 
What is also clear for the group to see is that these farms are not being tended to by anyone, this strikes the party as odd considering how perfect they are. But these farms are being tended to, and the group quickly spots humanoid figures made of copper and steel moving about in a rhythmic, almost dance-like pattern. 
 
Princess Fawn tries to communicate with the Automatons, and they respond in unison, "Hello, citizen!”. Cedric tries to determine the origin of the constructs, whether magical or technological, and can't think of a spell or a tinkering guild that would be able to create them. One thing is clear to Cedric: whatever they are or how they were made, they are not alive.
 
Past these initial farms, the party starts to notice that the farms lose their quality; the crops seem to be less bountiful or abundant despite the soil and growing conditions that are quite suitable for growth. These farms are tended to by people—an Elf farmer overlooking his pumpkins, a pair of Gnomes standing over and arguing around their potatoes.
 
As they walk through town, they notice that the town seems quiet, there are only a few people moving about town sullenly, as if each step is a test of will. There are also more Automatons whizzing about, carrying crates and barrels full of different goods, each built a little differently and customized to fulfil a designated purpose. There is even an Automaton built to keep the streets immaculately clean, large and wide, slow-moving, and making an odd whirring noise. For its lower limbs it doesn't have legs, but rather rotating disks with brush bristles underneath, and any debris kicked up is sucked up the leg of this construct.
 
The group continues to stare out the windows of their carriage and study the town as it passes by, the buildings here tell an interesting story. There are clearly some merchants that are doing very well. These buildings are pristine on the outside, clean and well maintained. Windows glisten and the hum of trained artisans at work inside can be felt like electricity in the air. Looking inside these buildings, Fawn notices that these shops are owned and operated by Automatons, moving rhythmically inside, as if each movement was calculated to provide maximum efficiency.
 
Then there are the shops that have seen better days, windows dusty or cracked. Signs hanging on by a single rusty hinge and creaking as they sway in the wind. Paint chipping away from the walls all tell tales of trying times for these merchants. One of these merchants is spotted outside sweeping their stoops and enjoying a nice pipe while doing so, the smell of fine tobacco fills the air.
 
The carriage passes over the bridge and arrives at the town hall, the doors are open and it unmissable to hear the multiple angry voices from within. There is a townhall meeting going on inside, a large confident and handsome Eladrin is addressing the unruly crowd.
 
Fawn tries in vain to politely get the attention of everyone inside the hall, but this task is no problem for Achroteth who slams the ground with his staff twice, it rings out and silences the crowd who all turn around. Fawn leads a conversation about the royal visit to Petalwood, soon enough the Mayor dispurses the citizens and has them unload the carriage with the provisions the group risked their lives to bring.
 
Mayor Finroth eloquently introduces himself, and the rest of the council that are sitting on the stage. Lilareth, the town Scribe; Aelarion, the town Purser; Thalaniel, the People's Representaive; and Althea, The Whisperer's Delegate.
 
Mayor Finroth explains that Elrohir has taken leave of Petalwood to finalise an important assignment, heading to the Tower of Luminaria for a few weeks. The Mayor is perplexed to hear that Elrohir has been sending reports that claimed the town was facing such a dire situation with the Fae, and that while some people have reported minor concerns, Finroth is sure that this would be true for all towns and cities and not concrete evidence of anything sinister.
 
The council all shoot worried glances at Althea, unsure of her reaction to these claims, perceptively Achroteth picks up on this and telepathically speaks to the Pixie to invite her to speak outside.
 
Cedric finds a seat inside and Achroteth, Rinji and Lullaby head outside to see that the carriage has already been unpacked and wait for Fawn to continue speaking with the Mayor.
 
Understanding the crown's concerns, Finroth agrees to share the most recent reports with Fawn and asks her to investigate the claims to help put her mind at ease. As a token of appreciation and fealty to the crown he offers to cover the cost of the Princess', and her friends', stay in Petalwood.
 
Achroteth, through use of Butch and Cassidee as his Postal Couriers (PC) sends an Enchanted-mail (Email) to the Tower of Luminaria for Sheriff Elrohir, asking for him to return urgently. As the rest of the group heads towards the tavern, Achroteth breaks off to speak to Althea.
 
She tells him that they are brave to arrive here. The situation in town is like a tinderboxready to burst into flames at any moment, that there are rogue disgruntled fae harassing people despite the current peace agreement and the Whispering Court are unsure why. Althea emplores Achroteth to bring these Fae in secretly as not to risk causing further division or anti-fae sentiment.
 
Althea also invites the party to come try a local delicacy at her bakery in town, Bake it to the Limit.
 
Lullaby and Rinji split off and head to a local blacksmith in town, True as Copper. They meet a large and imposing Automaton who provides a quote for the service requested that is currently outside their fiscal situation and the pair head to the tavern.
 
Arriving at the Troll’s Tollbooth, Martha greets her newest patrons and invites them some warm hospitality but thinks they are joking when they let her know the mayor is covering their stay. Fawn quickly identifies herself which changes Martha's tune.
 
The princess orders everything that Martha has to offer for a well earned meal, as well as some libations and a difficult to make fruit juice for Lulllaby.
 
During the evening, Achroteth steals away to spend some time out under the stars and creates a Star map, skillfully crafting constellations into some animal hide. Rinji comes to check on his brother, witnessing the completion of an ancient powerful druidic ritual and the activation of Achrotheth's star form for the first time.
 
The libations, rest and recreation continues inside for the heroes, Rinji drunkenly challenges a dwarf to an arm wrestle. He is so drunk the dwarf doesn't understand him and Cedric has to translate drunk, Rinji graciously loses.
 
It is late, the party are exhausted and the their room keys and head off to bed.
