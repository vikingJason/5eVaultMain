**Waterday, 3rd Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
Rinji, finished with his water play, joins Fawn and Lullaby at the Townhall to be regaled on what he missed.
 
Fawn wastes no time and requests the paperwork she needs to submit her request for the permit to host the Royal Gala. Glendelle obliges the request for multiple copies of the form. Glendelle notices that Lullaby keeps stealing bit of paper from Fawn and assumes it is in an attempt to keep himself entertained so provides some crayons to help keep him preoccupied.
 
Achroteth and Cedric, victorious in their quest to stop the logging, leave Motalon with the automatons and head for the Dryadâ€™s grove to update Mother on the outcome of their quest. They are met by wolves guarding the cave who escort the pair to the Dryad. Achrotheth explains, with reserved displeasure, that the errors of man have caused the break in the circle but they are now on a path to rectification. Mother, though angry with what has happened, rewards them with a basket containing 30GP, 200SP, 187CP, scrap automaton pieces and a wooden amulet on a leather cord.
 
Achroteth and Cedric head back to the Townhall to find Fawn still filling in paperwork to host her royal gala. Fawn beams with confidence that she has filled everything correctly however she learns that it will take longer than she was hoping for approval. She enquires with Glendelle about speeding up the approval process only to find that Fawn must fill in a separate request form.
 
While waiting for the beauracratic red tape to be traversed, Achrotheth and Cedric look over their new gift from Mother. At first glance, the amulet made from the bark of a great tree appears to have an intricate pattern carved into it. As they continue to stare they see that the pattern is carved in a way that shows a face when viewed at the right angle. They learn that the amulet (Nature Amulet) and the berries that are growing off it, will provide some aid. (+1 to Nature Checks for the wearer, eating the berries provides the benefit of Barkskin for 1 hour)
 
Rinji, who had grown bored of sitting around and doing paperwork, headed back to the Troll's Tollbooth. He starts working on a cloak made of the skins of the wolf they had slain in the cave days prior and surprises even himself with the quality of his craftsmanship.
 
Fawn finally completes the proper forms and submits them with Glendelle, paying the requested fees without hesitation, and a sudden surge of magical force whirls around the princess. Fawn hears a voice coming from a tiny plant on Glendelle's desk call out that it is thirsty, really thirsty. Fawn rushes to action and almost drowns the thankful plant with the water from a jug on the desk.
 
Unsure of what is going on Fawn rushes out of the building, heading off to start making preparations for the gala. First item on her agenda is to source an appropriate dress.
 
Cedric and Achrotheth head back to the tavern and before they can get to the stairs Martha intercepts us with her usual hospitality. Achroteth abandons Cedric to deal with her and heads upstairs.
 
Achrotheth takes some time to admire Rinji's new cloak and requests the Elk pelt and wolf skin scraps. Using the raw materials as well as his current leather armour, Achrotheth crafts himself some new Hide armour.
 
Cedric takes the automaton scraps and investigates them, under the ever-watchful gaze of Rinji. Cedric learns that these pieces of metal share some similarities, but also some big differences in their properties. Cedric's investigation is thwarted by Rinji taking scrap that he is certain relates to his destiny.
 
Fawn and Lullaby visit Faebric Fashions and are greeted by 3 Pixie tailors, Thread, Tinsel and Thimble. Fawn submits her request and met with a barrage of questions as they all agree on the perfect gown for the event.
 
Rinji heads downstairs, greeted by Martha who takes him to their regular booth and provides the requested libations. Rinji spots an Elf farmer in the tavern who looks a little beaten up and seeing an opportunity to find some real action around town, injects himself into their conversation. Rinji offers the farmer a jug of mead in exchange for the details and origin of his injuries, convinced that this would lead him to an opportunity to show off hsi might. The farmer reveals that the injuries were sustained during a workplace accident and that Redcaps paid him to help build a drainage system. When pressed for more information he explains that the first rule is that he can not talk about the details of the job, and the second rule is that he can not talk about the details of the job.
 
Rinji sits back at the usual table as Fawn and Lullaby arrive. Fawn talks with Martha about the upcoming Gala and pays the asking price for a round of drinks for the table. Fawns thoughts are invade by a nagging sensation that she really needs to learn and understand who this Sehanine is and why she appeared to her in the mirror at Pip's lair.
 
With group all gathered around the table, Rinji informs everyone of the Redcap situation. Martha takes their dinner order, Lullaby orders a hot chocolate which provides as much trouble as the fruit juice did.
 
An elven woman wearing a neighbourhood watch green cloak enters and storms over to the beaten farmer, berating him in front of all the patrons in the tavern. Martha tries to difuse the situation, but within moments Fawn walks over in her quest to stand for the side of justice fending off Felgan and her futile attempts to command the scene.
 
During their dinner, the party notice the farmer getting up from his table, leaving for work. Rinji tracks him stealthily through town and then out into the forrest to a run down old shack. Rinji sees the farmer go in but as he peers through the grimey windows the silhouette dissappears and there is no signs of life inside.
 
Fawn strikes up a conversation with Chef Galax about creating a menu for the Royal Gala. Galax is excited to show off his talent and can't wait to go prepare a tasting menu for Fawn to try that encompasses local delicassies and customs.
 
With a lot of hard work towards preparing her Royal Gala done Fawn retires to her room for the evening, and Achrotheth excuses himself from the table to head upstairs a few minutes after her.
 
Achrotheth asks Fawn about the brand of the symbol of Sehanine Moonbow that she has on her hand, wanting to help and shows her his star form. Achroteth explains to Fawn that Sehanine is one of the gods that his circle respects, but this is not enough to convince Fawn to share anything with him yet.
 
Back at the shack, Rinji breaks in to see an empty room that shows no signs that has anyone lived there recently. He discovers a trap door underneath a old rug and heads down the stairs. After descending 80 feet he comes to large double doors and knocks to gain entry. A peep slot opens up and a voice greets Rinji. After a quaint back and forth the doors remain closed to Rinji, who does not accept this outcome and creates a scene in the stairwell.
 
The locks on the doors can be heard unlatching and the doors open ...
