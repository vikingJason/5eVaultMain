## Session Overview 
 
**Moonday, 8th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 



%%aat-event-end-of-body%%


Achroteth doubled back to continue his discussion with Finroth, sharing the details about the Meenlock that they found and the deal with Brother Varras in exchange for the crystals from the Quicklings. An intrigued Finroth confirmed that the council will speak later today and then work out the deal from there.

As they walk out of the mayor's office, Achroteth, Lullaby and Dorgle run into Fawn who had just finished auditioning talent for the Unity Festival. Dorgle began to sow the seeds of deceit when Fawn questioned their new Drow companion, but the ruse was quickly squashed.

The adventurers returned to The Troll's Tollbooth, and seeing that Brother Varras was not around, Achroteth head to his room and continue to work on new attire.

Dorgle, under the guise of his new Drow appearance, began to prank Martha and take advantage of her hospitality. Dorgle's chaotic nature revealed itself when paying for a drink, sparking a burst of Wild Fae magic that enveloped the entire Inn. As the patrons in the tavern all began to inspect their new butterfly wings, Martha's lipped pursed as she muttered Dorgle's name under her breath, seething with anger. 

Brother Varras entered the tavern, and spotting the Princess, headed over to strike up another invigorating conversation. Fawn let Varras know that they would secure the Sacred Moonstone for him, and asked for any additional information about the ancient temple that they were going to travel to.

The spiritual Elf was eagerly shared with Fawn that the temple would definitely have safeguards, Sehanine frequently sets challenges before her followers and they may find themselves face to face with encounters that test their morals, and paths that force them to confront their fears. 

Brother Varras revealed that they will find the Moonstone in the The Heart of the Temple, but hesitated before offering a warning. He spoke of a rumour that he had heard long before, a rumour that many scholars have discredited. A rumour about Deity named Kalistyr.

Kalistyr was a close companion of Sehanine Moonbow. A minor deity of twilight, Kalistyr once took joy in guiding mortals from the brilliance of day into the mysteries of night. But as Sehanine grew more radiant in the eyes of mortals, Kalistyr became overshadowed. Worshippers began to revere Sehanine for her beauty, her wisdom, and her grace, leaving Kalistyr forgotten, reduced to whispers in fading dusk.

Over time, Kalistyr’s admiration of Sehanine twisted into jealousy, then into hatred. She craved the adoration that Sehanine received, a longing so deep it became a driving thirst—a hunger for worship that could never be satisfied. In her bitterness, she turned away from twilight’s balance and embraced the shadows entirely. Now, Kalistyr roams the mortal and divine realms as a force of envy, trickery, and false promises, luring mortals into her web of deception with whispers of empowerment and freedom.

Varras confessed to Fawn that he believes the rumours are true, and that a Fallen Cleric of Kalistyr guards the Sacred Moonstone. He added that those marked by Kalistyr are vulnerable to damage while in direct moonlight.

As evening was drawing near, Fawn knew that if they left immediately, that there would be sufficient moonlit hours that would provide them some protection. She raced out of the tavern, careful not get her butterfly wings caught. The doors of The Fermentary barely held to their hinges as Fawn burst through and gathered a visibly drunk Butch and Cassidee.

Their inebriation ate into the precious hours Fawn sought to take advantage of, each stumble adding to her growing frustration.

Having finished making his formal attire and admiring his work, Achroteth was interrupted by a knock at the door by Fawn, explaining that they needed to leave that very moment.

Outside, Butch and Cassidee's intoxication was not enough to disqualify them from driving the carriage, to the surprise of the passengers. Eventually Fawn remembered to tell the drivers where they were headed, but Achroteth was not so trusting in their faculties and used the stars in the night sky to guide them.

The carriage arrived at the dirt trail that Brother Varras described. Achroteth lit a torch as the travellers disembarked from the carriage and followed Fawn into the forest. Soon they were deep in a forest glade, surrounded by luminous trees whose leaves glowed silver in the moonlight. The air hummed  with quiet energy, and the scent of night-blooming flowers lingered on the air. 

Bioluminescent fungi drew their gaze to the location of the vine-covered archway that marked the entrance to the ruins. Pulling back the vines and moss that hid the entranceway revealed glowing moon-shaped sigils that flanked the archway. Flora crept along a cobblestone pathway, with even more brilliant bioluminescent plants that cast soft hues of blue and silver light.

The pathway lead to a wide courtyard. Statues of Sehanine, carved from moonstone, were scattered throughout, many were broken, their elegant forms crumbled into moss-covered rubble, while others remained intact, their serene faces gazing upward as if in prayer.

A reflecting pool, broken and cracked, lied at the center of the courtyard. Its waters shimmered unnaturally under the eternal twilight sky, reflecting constellations that weren’t visible in the sky above.

**Moonday, 8th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Achroteth paused, his thoughts calculated as he turned back toward Finroth's office. The mayor's gaze remained steady as Achroteth outlined the discovery of the Meenlock, its grotesque form and implications, and the delicate arrangement made with Brother Varras for the Quickling crystals. Finroth leaned forward, his fingertips steepled. The mayor’s intrigue was palpable as he assured Achroteth the council would convene by nightfall to deliberate.

As they exited the office, the trio found themselves face-to-face with Fawn, her presence commanding as ever. She brushed past them, radiant from her latest endeavor—auditioning talent for the Unity Festival. Her voice carried a mixture of curiosity and suspicion as she questioned the unfamiliar Drow who accompanied them. Dorgle’s attempt at deception unraveled almost immediately, leaving Fawn’s sharp eyes narrowing. The moment hung in the air, tension thick, until she shrugged and continued on her way, clearly unconvinced but uninterested in pressing further.

The adventurers returned to The Troll's Tollbooth, the air thick with the aroma of ale and firewood. Brother Varras was nowhere to be seen. Achroteth ascended the creaking stairs to his room, retreating into focused solitude. He worked meticulously on a new ensemble, the rhythmic snip of shears and the hum of thread against leather grounding him in the chaos of recent events.

Meanwhile, Dorgle, reveling in his new Drow guise, wove his peculiar brand of mischief through the inn. Martha, the ever-dutiful innkeeper, became an unwitting victim of his antics, her patience visibly fraying as he took liberties with her hospitality. When it came time to pay for his drink, Dorgle's unpredictable Wild Fae magic erupted yet again. A swirl of sparkling energy filled the tavern, and as the bewildered patrons stared at their newly sprouted butterfly wings, Martha's expression hardened. Her lips pursed in a thin line of restrained fury, and she muttered Dorgle's name under her breath, venom dripping from every syllable.

Brother Varras chose this chaotic moment to stride into the tavern, his sharp gaze locking onto Princess Fawn. With a measured step, he approached, his words flowing like a melody as he struck up a conversation. Fawn, ever decisive, assured Varras that they would secure the Sacred Moonstone. Her words carried the weight of determination, but she pressed for more information about the ancient temple they were about to face.

Varras spoke with reverence and caution. He explained that the temple, like all creations dedicated to Sehanine Moonbow, was shrouded in mystery and challenge. The goddess of the moon often tested her followers with trials of morality and fear. These challenges were not mere obstacles—they were reflections, crafted to illuminate the hidden truths within oneself.

But it was not this revelation that lingered in the air—it was the name Varras spoke next, a name many had dismissed as myth: Kalistyr.

The tale unfolded like the unspooling of an ancient thread. Kalistyr, once a minor deity of twilight and balance, had walked alongside Sehanine in harmony. But as the moon goddess grew radiant and worshippers flocked to her light, Kalistyr was forgotten. Admiration gave way to envy, and envy hardened into hatred. Rejected and unseen, Kalistyr embraced the shadows, twisting into a being of malice and manipulation. Now, she preyed on the weak and the ambitious, luring them with promises of power and liberation.

Varras’s tone grew somber as he shared his belief that the Sacred Moonstone was guarded by a Fallen Cleric devoted to Kalistyr. He cautioned Fawn and her companions that Kalistyr’s followers bore a curse—they were particularly vulnerable to the pure, unyielding light of the moon.

The weight of the revelation pressed heavy on Fawn. Her resolve, however, did not waver. The moonlight would be their ally tonight, and time was slipping through their fingers. Without a moment’s hesitation, Fawn dashed out of the tavern, her butterfly wings shimmering in the fading light. She burst into The Fermentary, where Butch and Cassidee were deep in their cups, laughter spilling from them in undignified bursts.

Fawn’s urgency clashed with their intoxication, her frustration mounting as she corralled the pair. Every stumble, every slurred word, was a reminder of the precious hours slipping away. The moon, her fragile shield, hung above them, a silver promise of protection that would not wait.

Achroteth stood back, hands resting on his hips, as he admired his work. The formal attire draped elegantly on the bed, every stitch precise, every fold purposeful. The fabric caught the dim light of the room, a testament to his skill and his attention to detail. He allowed himself a small, satisfied nod before a sharp knock at the door broke his reverie.

Fawn’s voice, urgent and unyielding, exclaimed they needed to leave, now.

Moments later, they were outside, where the scene awaiting him was equal parts amusing and concerning. Butch and Cassidee, visibly intoxicated, were already in the driver’s seats of the carriage, their faces red with drink and grinning foolishly. Fawn’s confidence in their ability to steer was startling, but the other passengers held their tongues. When, at last, Fawn remembered to tell the drivers their destination, Achroteth was already eyeing the stars. He trusted their guiding light far more than Butch and Cassidee’s unsteady hands.

The carriage rattled down the dirt road. When they reached the trail Brother Varras had described, the forest stretched before them like a velvet curtain, dark and impenetrable. Achroteth disembarked with the others, striking a torch to life. Its flame flickered against the cool night breeze as Fawn led the way into the woods.

The air shifted as they moved deeper, thickening with an almost tangible hum of energy. Luminous trees surrounded them, their silver leaves casting an ethereal glow across the glade. Shadows danced in the dim light, and the scent of night-blooming flowers drifted between them, rich and intoxicating.

Then, they saw it—bioluminescent fungi, glowing faintly in hues of violet and green, grew along the base of the trees and the forest floor. Their light was faint but persistent, enough to guide their gaze to the vine-covered archway looming ahead. The travelers slowed as they approached, the faint rustle of leaves the only sound breaking the stillness.

Pulling back the layers of moss and vines, sigils carved into the stone began to glow softly, their shapes forming crescent moons and stars that pulsed faintly in time with the forest’s energy. The archway stood as a threshold, a gateway into something ancient and sacred. Beyond it, the cobblestone path stretched forward, overrun with creeping flora that glowed faintly in hues of blue and silver.

They stepped through into a courtyard that seemed to exist out of time. Statues of Sehanine Moonbow stood like silent sentinels, carved from gleaming moonstone. Many were shattered, their forms reduced to moss-covered rubble, but the ones that remained intact gazed upward, serene and unyielding, their eyes turned toward an unseen celestial realm.

At the center of the courtyard lay a reflecting pool. Its surface was fractured, cracks splintering outward like veins of silver. Despite its disrepair, the water shimmered with an unnatural light, rippling softly as if it breathed. The constellations reflected on its surface were impossibly vivid, a mirror to a sky that didn’t exist above them.

And as the group stood there, their breath mingling with the forest’s quiet hum, they knew the trials had already begun.
