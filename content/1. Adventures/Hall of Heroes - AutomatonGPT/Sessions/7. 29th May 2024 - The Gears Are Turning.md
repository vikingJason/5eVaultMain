**Galeday, 2nd Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
Our party is still in the cave, standing before a Dryad and their Great Spirit Tree, still unsure of the situation.
 
Achroteth communicates with the Dryad in an ancient language, deeply rooted in nature, and learns that the natural resources are being depleted. The Dryad explains that they noticed it started two months ago and it has been getting worse and worse with each passing day. The trees and plants are dwindling, the river is starting to run dry, and the children of the forest are hungry.
 
In order to survive, the Dryad has taken drastic measures and used the beasts of the forest to attack the people of the village to find food.
 
Achroteth requests safe passage to investigate what is causing the resources to be depleted, to which the Dryad grants 24 hours of protection in the forest.
 
They all head back to town and encounter some townfolk along the way. Fawn stops to converse with a local, and when the subject turns to the Automatons, she notices that Davdar seems tense and nervous when discussing them.
 
They make their way to Bake It To The Limit to talk with Althea, knowing she can shed some further light on their theories.
 
Althea, a master baker with a delightful store, invites the party into her meeting room. As she sets down some treats for the group, she unkowingly creates tension between Rinji and Lullaby, who fight over the delicious cookies and pastries before them.
 
Fawn, like a true royal, diplomatically breaks the squabble so they can return to the task at hand. Althea reveals that the Automatons were brought in to assist the town, take over the menial work, the hard laborâ€”this was voted in unanymously by the council as Finroth and the rest are convinced this would lead to prosperity and a better quality of life for the whole town.
 
Althea explained that the Automatons had actually been in use for longer than two months; it was only 2 months ago that they became more prominent in the town itself.
 
Wanting to learn more about the Automatons, the party pressed on with their question for Althea and learned that the Automatons are not constructed in town, in fact she is not sure where they are constructed - Finroth signed a contract with a salesperson (who they recognise as the slick haired and aromatic stranger from the inn) and not longer after they arrived. The Automatons are housed in town, there is a storehouse for them when they are not in use near the Townhall, but only authorised representatives are permitted inside.
 
A bright spark of hope is quickly dimmed when Althea educates the group on the sometimes frustratingly lenghty democratic process when they request to become authorised:
- session to discuss and vote on receiving the request
- session to discuss and vote on reading the request
- session to discuss and vote on reviewing the request
- session to discuss and vote on how they will discuss and vote on approving the request
- session to discuss and vote on approving the request
- session to discuss and vote on when to responding to the request
- session to discuss and vote on the wording for responding to the request

Trying to stamp her royal authority, Fawn is humbled as Althea reminds her that as per Queen Reeva's (her own mother) Royal Decree - All villages, towns, hamlets, thorps, homesteads and other settlements, with a population not exceeding 485 individuals, are hereby granted the authority to self-govern through a democratic process they see fit.
 
Sensing the urgency of the situation, Althea explains that she would like tp help and with concrete evidence she can expidite the process under emergency measures.  Currently it would be difficult to cast doubts on the Automatons now with no real proof and submitting as evidence only the words of the Dryad, who has freely admitted they set beast upon the farmers and their livestock, will only lead to further the divide and influence against the Fey.
 
She further warns to exercise caution and seek further proof that there are other froces at play, which leads the conversation towards the note that they found in Pip's hideout from Rhyvesh and The Silent Adjudicators.
 
This concerns Althea to no end, and explains that the Silent Adjudicators, currently led by Arch Harbinger Rhyvesh, are a faction of Fey that splintered off and no longer recognise the authority of The Whispering Court. They aim to establish dominion where the Fey control Calindor from the shadows. They envision a world where Eladrin influence is diminished, major decisions are influenced by whispers from the Feywild, and the power rests firmly in the hands of the Fey alone.
 
The fact that Pip has been contacted by The Silent Adjuticators is perturbing, is it possible that they are trying to extend their influence?
 
The adventurers head back to The Troll's Tollbooth  to a humming common room. After some food and drinks, Cedric takes the opportunity to head over and talk to the mysterious stranger. The stranger introduces himself to Cedric as Laundithas, a sales representive of The Syndicate. The pair discuss the Automatons, in order to pry the secrets of this technology from the lips of Laundithas, Cedric tries to build common ground and talks of his own project, trying to create an automaton of his fathers pet drake, but Laundithas' mind is like a steel vault and he does not reveal the lucrative proprietary secrets.
 
However, Cedric does receive a great sales pitch from Laundithas, and learn that the Automatons can be hired or sold to any large organisation, business, merchant guild or government. When they sign the contract, they will be provided with however many Automatons they need on an ongoing basis and can be made to any specificities or customisations required. The Automatons are self powered and seld maintained. There are no upfront costs, it is an ongoing monthly fee that is payable.
 
Realising that Cedric can't make these decisions for the Clockwork Guild, Laundithas is almost uuninterested in Cedric, but continues the conversation to find out more about his mentor and master. 
 
As the evening draws on, the party sneak out to and head to the storehouse, Achroteth taking the back door and the rest of the party decending from their second story window with varying degrees of success.
 
As they approach the storehouse and see 2 large Automaton guards, Cedric clevely disguises himself to look like Laundithas and gains entry for himself and Achroteth. They enter and are greeted by rows of Automatons currently powered down and attached to a superfluous charging stations.
 
They locate an Automaton undergoing maintenance and learn that they are powered by a deep blue crystal that draws no energy from the environment around them. They quickly deduce that these crystals are obviously man made through a manufacturing process and undergo a powerful magic ritual that provides the properties that power the constructs.
 
Waiting and hiding outside, Rinji, Fawn and Lullaby, see mayor Finroth Tilvenar   approaching who spots an odditiy sticking out from the bushes and calls out to the not-so-stealthy look outs.
