The session opened with Rinji's attempt to gain entry to the Fight Club. As he approached, a dwarf exited, but Rinji paid little attention.

A Bugbear bouncer informed Rinji that entrance required membership or being the guest of a member. Realizing the departing dwarf was likely a member, Rinji hurriedly attempted to catch up but failed. He carefully surveys his surroundings as he makes his way back to Petalwood, ensuring that he can retrace his steps back to the Fight Club.
 
**Stoneday, 4th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**
 
Arriving back at Petalwood in the early hous of the morning, Rinji got some sleep and was greeted by Martha the next morning. She mentioned that she had requested his friends to help negotiate with the Brewmaster and offered him some delicious fruit pastries as he departs to catch up with them and not miss out on any of the fun they might get up to.
 
Rinji arrives at The Fermentary, meeting the Brewmaster but bypassing pleasantries, and ventured into the basement.
 
A little perplexed that no one seems to be down here, Rinji explores and finds a section of the wall pushed aside to reveal a tunnel. Following the tunnel he makes his way through a cave system and stumbles upon Cedric, standing guard with crossbow at the ready to protect the rest of the group from the unknown danger approaching. Cedirc is a little relieved that that the short, shadowy figure approaching was only Rinji.
 
After opening the locked door, the party, now joined by Rinji, make their way further into the cave system.
 
They come upon a storeroom area, a cave lined with shelves holding a bevy of different ingredients used in brewing and alchemy. Strangely enough, only the bottom two shelves are stocked.
 
Fawn heroically steps into the room first to inspect the secrets it may hold when four Rum Gremlins, creatures one foot tall with orange eyes and razor sharp teeth, emerge from the shadows and attack.

One of the Rum Gremlins escapes, while the other try to defend their lair from the party. The Rum Gremlins are ferocious, as they claw and bite, one let's out a wretched burp that causes Rinji to lose some of his faculties.
 
The party defeat the Rum Gremlins, splattering a potent smelling viscera everywhere when they do. Seizing the opportunity, Rinji and Dorgle scoop some if it up and store it in receptacles for later, use unknown.
 
The adventurers leave the room, Fawn again taking the lead. The tunnels start to fork, leaving the group with choices to make.
 
Dorgle licks his finger and sticks it out, feeling a breeze coming from one of the forks. Fawn, showing the she is in command of the situation, tries the same, and leads the party further into the cave.
 
The eventually find themselves staring down a tunnel the gets smaller and smaller the deeper you travel into it. Rinji wants to crawl down, eager for some action. Lullaby stops Rinji, and sits him of his shoulder, like a parrot on the shoulder of a pirate.
 
Fawn crawls down the tunnel, eventually getting to a point where moving further would risk her getting stuck. Fawn can see rays of sunlight peeking through some sort of barrier at the end, but decides to head ncak to the group.
 
While everyone is focused on the tunnel, Cedric peels away and searches the caves by himself. He finds a large room with a small bed, a night stand, a small chest at the foot of the bed and a bookshelf with a few books on it. Cedric heads to the chest, kicking through the empty booze bottles that litter every inch of the floor, creating a loud noise that reverberates through the cave.
 
In the chest, Cedric finds some old papers that crumble in his hands as he picks them up except for a single sheet that looks to have a recipe on it that he can't quite identify what concoction it produces.
 
Achrotheth and Fawn go to find Cedric, to see him carousing through the Bookshelf, finding a Botanical Volume of Plants and their different properties. There is also two books, of a three book series, about a brave halfling who must go on a dangerous trip to destroy a magic amulet in a magic forge.
 
The party all gather together and proceed to explore the rest of the cave.
 
The head down a dark tunnel and see light at the end. Fawn turns off her headlights, which alerts the creatures inside, a voice heard telling the rest to prepare to defend themselves and their precious rum.
 
A brazen Rinji calls out threatening to steal their stash of booze.
 
Dorgle and Fawn try to de-escalate the situation, the lord of the Rum Gremlin den inside concedes and allows only the two reasonable ones to enter without their weapons, the threat must stay outside.
 
Achroteth deduces that the Rum Gremlins dont actually know who was speaking and strategises that it would be best if he replaces Dorgle, entering the room with Fawn. He telepathically prepares Dorgle to enter the room and bring the pain, if he hears screaming.
 
A drunk, two foot tall variant of the Rum Gremlins faced earlier, stands before the pair, and negotiates with them.

As Fawn and Dorgle converse with the Rum Lord, they learn that the den has not been able to afford the alcohol that they need to survive. Their efforts to seeks assistance from the Whispering Court has not provided any relief, however all hope is not lost as they received correspondence from the Silent Adjudicators who have promised to send them whatever they need, but in the mean time must resort to stealing.
 
Fawn and Dorgle propose to the Rum Lord that they can secure a deal with the Brewmaster upstairs where they can work for him exchange for a share of the alcohol they help brew for him.
 
In a momentary lapse in judgement, the Rum Lord let's slip that he and his den can't seem to master brewing for some reason. They have been following the recipes that they stole and it doesn't seems to create anything potent enough for them.
 
Eventually the Run Lord does agrees to their proposal, on the condition that they prove their skill and knowledge of alcohol by brewing a batch from the recipe book.
 
Achrotheth convinces the Rum Lord to let Dorgle in to help, as a Dwarf he must be a master brewer.
 
Dorgle enters, and the Rum Gremlins fearful that he is the voice of the person who wants to steal their booze, keep a close eye on him - their hands on their weapons trembling.
 
Dorgle starts to prepare a batch, but the Rum Lord challenges him as to why he is not following a recipe from their book as per their agreement.
 
Tensions rise even further when Fawn requests to leave and make preparations for their deal upstairs, a request that is denied.
 
Dorgle starts to get the ingredients from the recipe, taking a large bucket to fetch some water with the assistance of Fawn.
 
Fawn notices that they have no escort as they leave to get the water and escapes upstairs with Lullaby and Rinji.
 
Cedric disguises himself to look like Fawn to not raise any suspicions.
 
Achroteth, Dorgle and Cedric (as Fawn), get to work on the brew, making only enough for two just in case.
 
The mix the right amount ingredients, crushing with a mortar and pestle, extracting the necessary components. The apparatus bubbles and steams, evidencing that something is happening to the combination of ingredients.

The resulting orange concoction is poured into two cups, one given to a Rum Gremlin, another for Achrotheth himself.
