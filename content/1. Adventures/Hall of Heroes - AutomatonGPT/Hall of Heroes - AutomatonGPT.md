##### CAMPAIGN HOOK

**What is this campaign about? What is the goal?**

- In a town where automatons have been created to help with completing all the jobs around town, the trouble the town are facing are only the tip of the iceberg 










**

- The Whispering Court - seek to Protect all Fae Creatures now that Calindor has Removed from the Feywilds and there is no ArchFey
    - The Silent Adjudicators - break away faction that believe they need to take extreme measures to ensure the Fae creatures dominate over the Eladrin
- The Knights of the First Order - the Elite Company of Guards that swore to protect the crown and those that wear it
    - The Dawn's Shadow - secret arm of the order who complete undercover investigations to prevent anything from occurring that may harm the realm
- The Spectral Vanquishers - investigate and protect from undead and paranormal occurrences
* The Alathar Sceptre - a group that believe that the Eladrin should be the dominant species in Calindor. Coexistence can only be possible with full submission.
- The Syndicate - a group of wizards, scientists and engineers who develop technologies to dominate the world. They live and work in underground chambers, protected by runes and automatons, and often attack settlements for supplies and test subjects.
- 
- Multiverse Intervention Block - short MIB, A shadowy organization that deals with beings from another realm, unknown to most people. Conspiracies have formed about the existence of this group. It consists of highly trained mages and fighters who seem to be wherever some unidentified creatures causes havoc. They always wear black and seem somewhat inhuman to the people they encounter. Unfortunately, nobody ever remembers their faces or what happened after their visit.

If you tell the trees a juicy secret that no-one else knows they will open the path to wherever you wish to go. The trees will rustle outwardly from the tree you told the secret too as it tells the other trees next to it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 5    | A fey fighting exhibition. Many of the fey, when slain in the fey realms, simply appear once more alive some time after, be it a few hours or days later (unless executed by the Fey courts, or special preparations taken by the combatants to ensure death) -- as such, fighting exhibitions can quickly become bloody, brutal affairs, but with little lasting consequence to the participants. It is also not uncommon for fey fighters to pull forth concealed weaponry, and it being totally within the rules of the ring to do so. Mortals participating in these fights do not have such protection as almost-guaranteed resurrection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 6    | The party encounters a stretch of rocky terrain which proves very difficult to walk through. The stretch ends abruptly at a sheer cliff, over the edge of which there appears to be a grassy forest growing out sideways. Looking back, the party suddenly realizes they've been walking up a sheer cliff.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| 9    | The Feywild is mutable and ever changing, and the Queen's Palace is no exception. While the party is traversing the Feywild, they come across a Museum Gallery Wing juxtaposed with the other normal terrain nearby. Subtle owl motifs emerge, (and aside from the nearly perfect weather and lighting conditions) the only clues to the change are that statues and artworks appear out of the ground as if inextricably part of the natural landscape. This particular wing is a bit overgrown, and guarded by 1d3+1 Guardian Portrait from Curse of Strahd and 1d4 Animated Armor. For a higher level encounter, add a Stone Cursed from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, a Clay Gladiator from Tomb of Annihilation, or a Caryatid Column from 3e Fiend Folio. Despite the overgrown nature, mere mortals shall never gaze upon the works of art and beauty the Queen holds dear, making trespassing here very dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 17   | A friendly tin automaton in a copse of hazel trees, wielding an ax and a flute made from a metal jug and a funnel. The automaton playing the flute causes the copse of hazel to quickly grow into the shape of large, fine, living cages, which the automaton uses the ax to cut down. Careful observation of the automaton's chest might reveal dried blood, opening the chest reveals a beating heart. Once a month, when the moon is full, the automaton is driven to kill, in order to replace the heart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 18   | A veritable mountainous bower of house sized flower petals covers the ground, forming a pile literally the size of a small mountain, and reeking of lovely perfume fragrance. At the center of the pile, seemingly placed lovingly, is the corpse of a gargantuan bumblebee mount, with fine saddle and tackle, barding, etc. sized for a humanoid or possibly even a large creature to ride. It is covered in "giant" (small sized) fire-ants, literally ants that burn with flame, and surrounded by towering tree-sized poles of smoking incense. It is difficult to tell if the ants are devouring the corpse, or guarding it; perhaps it is both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

A loud snap and the sudden disappearance of a moose that was drinking on the other bank prove swimming a dangerous course of action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 21   | A flock of half-sized miniature black kenku, a too tall fey with several extra joints, and a clockwork wagon piled high with fine trade goods. The kenku are skilled crafters, and on the wagon are portable workshops of many kinds, including a miniature blacksmith forge, a wind-up loom, potter's wheel, kiln, and apothecary. The skinny fey is dressed as an undertaker, all in black, their lips and eyes have been sewn closed, and their long fingers end in sewing needles a foot long. They have a set of extra joints in between each joint a normal humanoid possesses, and appear to be double-jointed, at that. The fey offers tailoring of outfits, and sells everything from silken robes woven by spiders, to transparent gowns made of only large dragonfly wings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 22   | A lovely orchestra made up of fey creatures. They carry traditional musical instruments, such as the violin or the flute. They all are very posh and elegant, and inform the party that they are going to see the fairy queen. If the party asks to hear the music, they put on a performance. The twist, all music is very loud, sweary, and is rock music.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 29   | There is a rectangular hole in the ground surrounded by cut stone. There is no visible water and the walls are dark with ash. A small head pops out from the side and asks if they are there to deliver their presents. If they don't throw down a present the child's head will start to climb the chimney and is revealed to be a creature who steals faces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 30   | The mutable nature of the feywild extends to other Arch Fey's Palatial Estates as well. While the party is traversing the Feywild, they come across a wing of an Arch Fey's palace resembling a Greco-Romantic Boudoir juxtaposed (but also elegantly entwined) with the other normal terrain nearby. A copse of dryads in humanoid form are Ladies in Waiting for the Arch Fey, the players suddenly find them in a compromised position, and much embarrassment is had by all. The players must not be caught by the Arch-fey's Guards, however, or the fun will end. 1d6+1 Blink Dogs and 1d2+1 Yeth Hounds from Volo's Guide to Monsters hunt the party through the halls and gardens, along with a Forlarren (from Mordenkainen’s Fiendish Folio Volume I) and 1d4 Twigjacks converted from Pathfinder Bestiary 2. All the pursuing searchers wear the Arch Fey's Livery, and aim to kill half of the party, and capture, interrogate, and then torture the rest to death.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 32   | The party comes across a circular stream, roughly 100 feet in diameter, crossed by two footbridges. Going under either of the bridges leads to another identical stream somewhere else. The stream goes through 1d4 such portals before returning to the original circle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 33   | A majestic imperial stag fully 50 hands tall, bearing a rack of antlers with at least 24 points. The stag wears a collar with a gold sigil of the Fey Queen.

| 39   | The Feywild has its own version of every biome in the Material Plane, and sometimes more than one, and often very very wild. The Feywild Ocean is particularly mercurial, occasionally "deciding" to move inland. Seemingly overnight, the terrain the party is on becomes a very small island in a very large sea. Locals take this in stride, adapting as if it were any other day. This progresses for 1d6 days, before reverting to its former state, leaving the players once more in whatever biome they were in before the ocean moved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 40   | A terrified looking person is found balancing a goblet on their head filled to the brim with water. They will plead for the party to help them. They explain that a fey puts the goblet there and that if a single drop of water falls from the goblet they will die.

Examination of the water or goblet reveals it is ordinary, and if any of it spills nothing happens.

If asked what they are doing, they tell the players they are organizing a race, and invite the players to join. Players can either run, use their own mounts (any & all are accepted) or they can rent a mount for a certain amount of gold. In total, about 100 fey creatures compete in the race, and will use underhand tactics to win                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 43   | A forest fire, set by a giant wolf made of ash and flame, in hot pursuit of spectral, god-sized prey, and some say, its long-lost mate. The wolf is accompanied by a large pack of smaller ash-wolves, who tend to attack and surround prey of their own. The creatures can speak, and at least one of them is a Shifter Druid and can be reasoned with, and they venerate the giant ash wolf, following the fires it starts, making hunting easier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 44   | The players come across a beautiful clearing in the woods that the denizens refer to as 'The Dancing Grove'. A massive tree sits in the middle of the clearing, with musical instruments made of sticks, twigs, and reeds dangling from its branches. Every full moon, the massive tree comes alive and begins playing all of the instruments at once, creating some of the most beautiful music the players have ever heard. Creatures from all around come to the Dancing Grove to hear the enchanting music.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| 48   | A crossroads encounter with a number of fey threatening what appears to be wealthy humanoids who owe a debt. The fey are very restrained, civil, and polite, but they are a real threat, and are emissaries from a group of fey who perform assassinations for hire in the mortal world, and know of a way to easily transit between the realms, at least reliably enough to kidnap wealthy individuals and threaten them at a fey-crossroad! The fey threats have names like: "Herb Robert" (They are the spokesman, also known as "Death-Comes-Quickly"), "Johnny Jump-up", "Black-eyed Susan", "Jack-in-the-Pulpit", and "Golden Alexander", and each wear a flower matching their name, and in some way reflect the plant they are named for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

The surrounding creatures are getting concerned, because a satyr party can easily spin out of control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 50   | The players meet an extremely kind and helpful fey that, unbeknownst to them, has the ability to demand favors in return for any favors they give. The fey will attempt to get characters as much on their debt as they can with food, shelter, hospitality and perhaps even fending off some wild creatures for them, and the favors it asks can't be ignored by the players, as if they were under the effects of a powerful spell. However, the fey limits its requests to silly things that would get you laughed at.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 52   | A mining settlement inside of the corpse of a beyond-gargantuan elemental comprised of once-living gemstone. Multiple levels of glittering gemstone have been carved into spectacular, if grisly cathedrals and vaults. The Queen of the Fey has ordered the mine to move the entire corpse and turn it into a new palace, but it has become infested with gemstone themed spirits that slaughter anyone who disturbs them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 53   | The players spot a group of animated shrubs that are talking in common, plotting world domination. However, they lack the wits, resources and manpower to pull it off in any conceivable way, and all but the leader can be scared off pretty easily. The leader is likely to hold a grudge if the party messes with the gathering.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 55   | A rare species of rabbit that can comprehend most languages. Their unique fur changes color from white to a blue-ish black, matching the phases of the moon, and they also grow in size, starting as normal rabbits on a new moon and eventually growing to large size during a full moon.

However sometimes a building or two will break from the herd and go its own way; one normally close location is now further away, and seemingly doesn't want to be found, and the Players have been tasked with tracking it down and possibly leading it (the instructions are vague) back to the city proper!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 68   | Snow begins to fall from a clear sky. As soon as the last bit of ground is covered, all fey creatures begin digging at the snow, which is somehow several inches, or even feet, deep. They begin pulling fruit from beneath the snow, with white skin and purple meat. The fey alternate between gorging themselves with the fruit and using them as projectiles and weapons against others in a joyous frolicking melee. If consumed, the fruit's texture is that of a medium-rare steak and has an alternating flavor that moves from tangerine to pear and back. Eating the fruit grants a feeling of warm youthful days playing with friends by the river. After 10 minutes the snow on the ground clears as though it was never there. Any fruit kept lasts 6d12 hours before disintegrating into sparkling dust with a slight toot and a child's laughter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 77   | A lovely park table and set of benches set with a fine and intricately carved set of jeweled game pieces for a strange 13 by 13 square type of chessboard with 46 pieces each. A lifelike statue of a player sits on one bench, with the board in an early-mid game state. Moving a tile triggers the curse. The secret trick is that each side is petrified while it is not their turn, until a winner is chosen. A non-petrified player may leave the game, and unfortunately, until it is finished, the other player may not be unstuck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The entire fey countryside is gathered around a well set beneath a decrepit statue of the ancient god, with eleven faces in different directions and strange expressions. Surrounding the well in a perfect circle is a copse of Larch with dry, golden leaves, and ten of the faceless priests have tied themselves up inside the branches. The eleventh though, refuses, and is fighting with the crowd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 79   | The party comes across a field of giant pumpkins the size of houses. A few of the pumpkins have strange music playing from near or inside them. A fey field-worker struggles to set up an instrument and loudspeaker combination, alternately moving mindlessly, and then humming whatever music matches coming from the giant gourds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 80   | A solitary willow sister can be seen dancing around her willow tree, attempting to revive it. The tree is covered in a bright red fungus, and looks to be heavily infected.

| 81   | A field full of patches of Glimmergrass, tall grass patches of glass-like iridescent plants. A creature within 5 feet of a specific patch of Glimmergrass has the effect of Mirror Image, unless they already have an effect like it active (in which case no additional effect occurs). The effect of anything within the fields is like stepping into a maze full of funhouse mirrors. A hunting party of 1d6+1 goblinoids stalk the fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| 83   | The party arrives at a forest that has come alive. Each of the trees has a soul and talks to the party, and if the party looks at one of the leaves, they will see the veins forming the picture of a little room inside the leaf, and a little leaf dude sitting at his table for afternoon tea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 84   | 2d6 Red-Skinned Satyrs wearing "fake" Devil costumes and wielding mining equipment. At least one is either a Sorcerer or Warlock, or a Forlarren from Mordenkainen’s Fiendish Folio Volume I . When not aggressively attacking anyone nearby they are busy digging into a set of beyond-gargantuan teeth embedded in the ground like one half of a giant mouth. The "devils" seem intent on causing cavities and tooth decay in the giant teeth, and are aggressive to anyone who approaches. They have been cursed/charmed to be this way. However, in addition to being cursed and humiliated, they have also been cursed with illusory dental-pain that exactly mirrors the damage they deal to the giant teeth. Those who approach within 60 feet of any afflicted must make a Moderate DC Wisdom save each round or be forced to participate in the cavity causing activity, those who succeed on the save are immune for 1 hour. Additionally, each round, the illusory dental pain may be resisted with a second Moderate DC Wisdom save. Those that succeed on that save are immune to the effect for 1 hour as well. The illusory pain affects Concentration checks as if receiving 3d6 hp worth of damage (but it does not deal actual damage). |
| 85   | A Fey noble has decided that he doesn't want to be a noble any longer.

| 86   | The Pied Piper, yes, that one... fresh from returning after stealing away the rats and children of Hamelin. The children and rats are both here, and the Piper tries to play dumb. But there are political implications to freeing the children. Namely, without them, the Fey realm is in debt to the Nine Hells. A tithe is paid every seven years in the form of children's souls to remain neutral and uninvaded. Interfering will result in incurring the wrath of the Queens.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 87   | The mutable nature of the feywild extends to the Queen's Palace as well. While the party is traversing the Feywild, they come across a Royal Wing juxtaposed with the other normal terrain nearby. Beautiful golden screens; priceless, eggshell thin ceramic vases, and polished brass mirrored walls form a sort of whispering gallery, occupied by a Spring Eladrin and an Annis Hag from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, along with a number of lesser co-conspirators. They are discussing some sort of curse, assasination, or coup against the Throne. Should they discover the players, they will attempt to capture, then charm the group into obedient thrall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 89   | A gaggle of twenty-score nobly dressed humanoids, each tied at the waist and wrist to another by a silken cord, wearing woven crowns of marigolds, along with a veritable army of fey servants in fine livery keeping herd, many have several blackbirds perched on their shoulders. The servants keep playing the humanoid nobles with wine, sweet-meats, sweet smelling smoke, and are feeding them lotus blossoms, marigolds, and mushrooms. One of each group of noble's servants is wearing fine brocade robes, has an elaborate and imperious head-dress, and seems most versed in magical enchantments. If questioned, the nobles will claim they are headed to a brothel, urge the party to stay, and offer to cover their tab. If questioned, instead, the fey "in charge" will explain the gaggle are late for a wedding and urge the group to leave them be and stop contributing to the chaos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 90   | A noble minotaur herdsman named Sir Cease, leading his herd of ... wait.. are those people? They look like people, but are twice the size, and have thick curly hair on their heads, and they all have beards. They eat grass like cattle and sound like them too, and none are capable of speaking. They'll fetch a fine price, and might even grace the Queen's table, according to the Herdsman.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 91   | The players run into a human that has been cursed by a mischievous fey into thinking they are a cat. This becomes evident when the person does silly things such as wonder out loud how the players can spot them hiding inside a small bush that could never conceal their actual body proportions, or when they attempt and fail to climb trees or walls using their bare hands and feet. If befriended, the person might ask the players to help lift the curse, either by means of a spell or by confronting the fey that cursed them and getting it to remove the curse through some kind of bargain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

A powerful, crazed dryad guards the grove the patch is located in and hates all creatures, seeing them as fit only for fertilizer, and will actively kill any who approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 96   | The Queen's Garden is known to be vast; so vast in fact that no single Gardener knows the true extent or boundary of it! You'll know you're in the Queen's Garden by the Owl Motif subtly hidden in sight. Those who trespass on the Garden are not known for living long and peaceful lives. The problem is, the Garden is secretly growing, and seemingly overpowering the Will of the army of Master Gardeners who tend it. None dare approach the Queen about the issue, and it enveloped the entire Village of West Bollingbrook last week! Find the Villagers, please?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 97   | An entire traveling shoe-store of enchanted (cursed) dancing shoes. The shoes are animated, and are here to do two things, Look Good, and Kicking Ass.. and they're done looking good. Amongst the 1d4 Swarms of Animated Shoes (use Swarm of Flying Books , but reskin them to be various boots, clogs, sandals, slippers, etc) are a number (a number that is level appropriate for the party) of tougher, Daz's Iron Boots of Retribution; they are each a pair of metal boots that have the Heat Metal ability (Bonus Action, Recharge 4-6; as the spell) against a target they have successfully attacked in melee this round; additionally, until the start of it's next turn, any creature adjacent to or touching the object (for instance, in order to grapple) must beat a Easy-Medium DC Constitution save, or take 1d8 Fire damage. For Daz's Iron Boots stats, use a CR1 Medium Animated Object, and increase AC by +2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 98   | A group of goblins are dragging along what looks like a cannon. They’re all equipped with iron weapons. If asked they announce that they intend to kill the Queen, and, after devouring her flesh and stealing her power, destroy the lady of pain, Asmodeus, and Vecna. If fought they’re strong enough to force the players to retreat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 99   | A group of fey are playing free-for-all pretend spell battles, and invite the players to join them. Each participant is given an illusory pool of HP matching their maximum HP and a bunch of random spoof spell scrolls of all sorts of powerful magic that anyone can use (playing cards could be used to symbolize different spells of all levels). As for the rules of the game, the scrolls deal illusory damage, participants who lose all their illusory hit points are taken out of the game, and anyone that deals damage through other means is immediately disqualified.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 100  | A belch loud enough to be heard by the entire party comes from one of the party’s bags. Inside is a portly sprite snoozing atop a half-eaten rations. The sprite has been traveling with the party for a while, eating their food, and fell asleep after a hearty meal. They happily provide information about the area, but despite any efforts to stop the sprite, they somehow manage to always be munching on a morsel of the party’s supplies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
