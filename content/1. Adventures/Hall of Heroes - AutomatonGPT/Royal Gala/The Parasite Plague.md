### **Key Elements**

#### **1. The Mystery Begins**

The players and townsfolk begin showing symptoms of illness:

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, muscle weakness, irritability, and failure to recover from long rests - (green boils on the the ankles).
- **Clues**: Players notice townsfolk who drink water regularly are worse off, while Fey creatures (e.g., a sprite merchant or dryad) seem unaffected.
	- Medicine Check will show something moving underneath the boil/small grub like creature
		- The parasites are naturally occurring but not native to this region.

**Initial Investigation**:

- Talking to a local healer or herbalist reveals that symptoms match those caused by parasites. The healer suspects the water supply is contaminated and directs the party to investigate the dam.
- until such time as the water purifiers are fixed, Mayor Finroth offers to provide the town the license to use his deep spring well, for a nominal fee.
- The party learns from townsfolk that the purifiers stopped working after the wild magic surge. Automatons were deployed to repair the dam.

#### **2. Investigating the Dam**

The party travels to the dam to inspect the purifiers and encounters obstacles:

- **Obstacle: Broken Purifiers**
    
    - The purifiers show signs of damage consistent with sabotage. With an **Investigation (DC 14)** or **Arcana (DC 15)** check, the players discover:
        - The wild magic surge initially caused minor damage.
        - Automaton parts are scattered around the entrance to the dam
        - Someone/something tried to fix it, however was not skilled enough and broke it the purifiers further, making repairs almost impossible.

- **Discovery of Fey Parasite Host**:
    
    - Exploring the dam and following the stream, the party encounters a dead **Fey creature** (Meenlock) infected with parasites at the bottom of the stream, flowing into the dam.
    - This Meenlock (an unknown host) was drawn to the magic used in the dam and unknowingly released the parasites into the water.

#### **3. Repairing the Purifiers**

The party must fix the purifiers to clean the water supply. While repairing the machinery, they face new challenges:

- **Repair Process**:
    
    - Repairs require a combination of skill checks over three rounds:
        1. **Arcana (DC 13)** to restore the magical seals.
        2. **Investigation (DC 14)** to identify damaged components.
        3. **Tinker’s Tools (DC 14)** or **Strength (DC 15)** to realign the machinery.
    - Players must protect the purifier during the repair process.
- **Combat Encounter: Infected Beasts**
    
    - As repairs begin, infected animals (e.g., wolves or large rats) attack the dam. These creatures are zombified and show signs of parasitic infestation.
    - **Combat Mechanics**:
        - These creatures are resistant to non-magical slashing damage and have a chance to infect players who take melee damage (Constitution save, DC 12, or suffer exhaustion).

#### **4. The Final Fight: The Infected Fey Host**

As repairs near completion, the source of the parasite emerges: an **infected Fey creature** that has mutated due to the infestation. This could be a **dryad**, **satyr**, or **nymph** transformed into a corrupted version of itself.

**Final Boss: Corrupted Owlbear Host**

- **Appearance**: The Fey is grotesquely overgrown with pulsating, parasitic tendrils. Its movements are jerky, and its glowing eyes radiate desperation.
- **Abilities**:
    - Parasitic Tendrils: Melee attack that deals necrotic damage and spreads the parasite (Constitution save to avoid exhaustion).
    - Aura of Decay: Creatures within 10 feet of the Fey must succeed on a Constitution save (DC 13) at the start of their turn or take 1d6 poison damage.
    - Summon Minions: Calls additional infected creatures to fight alongside it.
- **Tactics**: The Fey fights defensively, protecting the parasite within it, but may become vulnerable if the players attempt to purge the parasite instead of killing it outright.

**Purging the Parasite (Optional)**:

- If the players want to save the Fey, they must incapacitate it and use magic (e.g., _Lesser Restoration_ or Fey-related spells) to purge the parasite.
- Can try a potion from the book obtained from the Rum Gremlins

### **Physical Remedies**

Some Feywild parasites might need to be extracted through physical or magical means.

- **Herbal Remedies and Antitoxins**
    
    - A concoction of Feywild herbs like **Glowthorn Root**, **Moonberry Extract**, or **Everbloom Petals** could neutralize the parasite's influence. The remedy might require a **Medicine (DC 15)** or **Herbalism Kit (DC 13)** check to prepare.
    - **Complication**: The process might involve dangerous Feywild foraging or a recipe only a Fey NPC knows.
- **Surgical Extraction**
    
    - If the parasite is physically embedded, it might require careful removal. Players could use a **Medicine check (DC 15-18)** or require a skilled healer NPC.
    - **Risk**: The host could take damage or face permanent injury if the extraction fails.

### **Rewards**

1. **Gold or Items**: Payment from grateful townsfolk or the Princess for solving the crisis.
2. Book for teaching herbalism.
3. Memory Petal or Feywild Nectar
4. **Political Leverage**: Evidence against the mayor can be used in future encounters or negotiations.

---

### **Potential Hooks for Future Quests**

1. The mayor retaliates, deploying automatons to suppress dissent.
2. The parasites’ sudden appearance hints at growing instability between the Feywild and the Material Plane, leading to further wild magic surges.
3. The Fey host becomes an ally or source of information about Feywild dangers.

This side quest offers a balanced mix of combat, mystery, and political intrigue, tying the water contamination to the mayor's broader schemes while providing engaging challenges for the players.
