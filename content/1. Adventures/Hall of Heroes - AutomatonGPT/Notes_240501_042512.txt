When they enter the town they first notice farms.

Well maintained and lush with crops perfectly symmetrical, spaced equal distance apart. The smell of fertiliser wafts through the air, but almost with an enticing sweetness.

The sounds of sheep and cattle draw your attention to pastures where these farm animals are grazing without a care in the world. They look almost happy, and you swear that you can see them smiling.

You don't see any people tending to these farms however.

You do see some movement and and as you get closer you see these almost humanoid figures moving about in this rhythmic almost dance like pattern.

These are Automatons, bipedal constructs made from dulled copper and brass. Their faces have what can be described as 2 eyes and a mouth.

If you stare into them you see no soul behind those eyes, these Automatons are definitely not alive, but they move about with no visible operators around.

If you talk to them they give short simple answers, they concern themselves with doing their primary directive and helping those in need (which is secondary).

They will provide directions, but no real insightful information.

As they move past these initial farms they start to notice that the farms lose their quality, the crops seem to be not as bountiful or abundant.

The soil and growing conditions looks suitable for growth.

You see that these farms are tended to by people, an Elf farmer overlooking his pumpkins, a pair of Gnome standing over and arguing around their potatoes.

The Gnomes will distrustful and cautious if anyone tries to talk.
They want to get on with their jobs.
They will not be hostile.
- if pressed will drop comments about struggling to grow anything recently, with the threat of the Quicklings in the area constantly stealing their fertiliser.
- And the dammed robots getting priority with any resuuplies that do make it to town
- just want enough to feed their pet ....
- pet is sick, asks them if they can help

The Elf will be friendly, but hard-working, sweat beading from his brow. Shirt unlaced revealing a smooth and chiselled chest.
- he is pleasant and does not complain
- keeps his head down and just tries to provide for the town
- will answer questions but won't be able reveal much about people
- happy that the mayor is doing everything he can to keep the whole town prospering
- sometimes this means that tough choices have to be made and you can't always keep everyone happy all the time
- we voted for him and this is the cost of democracy
- would love to be able to afford a sweet treat from the town baker, asks if he can impose and ask them to buy him one if it's not too much trouble

As they walk through town they notice that the town seems quiet, you notice only a few people moving about town sullenly, as if each step is a test of will.

You also see some of those same Automatons whizzing about, carrying crates and barrels full of different goods. 
(Insight check reveals that when the people do notice they regards these Automatons with disdain)

As you see more and more of the Automatons you notice that they are all built a little different, customised to fulfill their designated purpose.

The farming drones had a hand the size and shape of a shovel and one the could obviously be used as a hoe.

Those carrying crates and barrels had longer and flatter arms.

The streets of Petalwood are spotless. Even though these are compacted dirt paths, you notice that there is no sign of dirt kicked about by traffic. You notice a large and wide, slow moving automaton making an odd noise down the path in front of you. For its lower limbs you notice that it doesn't have legs, but rather rotating disks with brush bristles underneath. Oddly however this activity is not spitting dirt everywhere, intact you see that any debris kicked up seems to be sucked up the leg of this construct.

You notice that the buildings you see throughout the village tell an interesting story, there are clearly some merchants that are doing very well. These buildings are pristine on the outside, clean and well maintained. Windows glisten and the hum of trained artisans at work inside can be felt like electricity in the air.

As you look inside these buildings you cant help but notice that these shops are owned and operated by the Automatons inside, moving rhythmically, as if each movement was calculated to provide maximum efficiency.

There are shops that have seen better days, windows dusty or even cracked. Signs hanging on by a single rusty hinge and creaking as they sway in the wind. Paint chipping away from the walls all tell tales of trying times for these merchants.

One merchant you see outside sweeping their stoops and enjoying a nice pipe while doing so with the smell of fine tobacco filling your nostrils as you pass.

One  merchant, an older looking human stands to attention as they notice you and start to wipe their hands on their trousers and a wide smile shines on their face.

You see that there are a few stores that are empty at the moment with a closed sign on their door, and some appear to just be vacant with no sign that anyone has set food inside for a while.

You see a large building, large doors

And the inn next to it.

The Tavern has 1 patron at the moment, and the 1 dwarf behind the bar.

She is excited to see visitors and explains that there is a townhall session on at the moment.
* they are discussing the issues of the town
* Fae bandits/creatures disrupting the town
* it asked about the Automatons he looks around the bar before leaning in and whispering that the Automatons are great and a blessing for the town
- Insight check reveals that her tone and facial body language don't seem to match her words, and you see that she keeps shooting glances over at the single patron. (If pressed further won't say anything more)

!!! Who is the Patron: A member of The Syndicate. He is well dressed, clothes are of fantastic quality and cleaned and pressed perfectly. His jet black hair slicked back with some sort of gel or ooze. An entailing scent emanates from his direction, musky with an aromatic spiciness to it.

He says not much to the group, that he is there to enjoy the countryside, and the fine ales it has to offer.

If pressed he says that he is also their to inspect his wares and ensure that they are meeting the expectations of the purchasers.
He can reveal that he is the person who sold the Automatons to the town, but he is not the creator, simply a great sales person.

Has the contract signed and does t even have to send it off because a few days later the Automatons are delivered, almost by magic he jokes.

Need Bakery and Apothecary ready

Bakery owner is representative on the Council, is in session at the moment
