## Session Overview 
 
**Stoneday, 4th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

[[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]], still unsure about what drink to order from the barman finally decides that maybe he should check out what is going on in the fighting pit that has the crowd all riled up. Seeing [[Achroteth]] in the arena along with a bevy of different foes secures some rope to a bench and lowers it down to help.

[[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]], sure that his magic won't help from up top, is surprised when his magic stones are able to pass through the magical wards that are meant to protect the arena, striking the creature in the fighting pit. [[Byll & Teadd]] hoist themselves out of harms way while [[Achroteth]], with the help of [[Bax]], defeat the remaining beasts. [[Fawn]] deals with the Dire Wolves in the tunnel, securing her path to the fighting ring to see that the situation was under control.

The frenzied crowd, believing it all to have been part of the planned exhibition start to calm and eagerly await the next fight while  [[Achroteth]] starts dealing with the carcasses of the animals, moving  them to edge of the fighting space. The trio head to the fighter's lounge and are greeted by [[Gnarl Bloodclaw|Gnarl's]] lifeless body. [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] pilfers the champions short swords, before they all head to [[Rorick]]'s office.

[[Lullaby]] still hiding and awaiting to see the face of the culprit breaking in to [[Rorick]]'s office see's a slender blonde elf wearing a green cloak sneak in and start to rummage through the filing cabinets. Sitting in the large desk chair with his back turned to the intruder, [[Lullaby]] perfectly mimics the voice of the redcap owner, startling the elf and persuading him to leave quickly.

[[Rorick]] is impressed with [[Lullaby]], offering him a job which he politely declines to continue adventuring.  The party regroup in [[Rorick]]'s office and confirm that the animals have been dealt with. Capitalising on [[Rorick]]'s gratefulness to the group for their assistance, they convince the manager that the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] are responsible for what has happened this evening and that all of the "green cloaks" should be banned. [[Rorick]] agrees and signs the order for all green cloaks to be banned from this day further, and orders that any still in the club are round up for questioning, showing off his assortment of information extraction apparatus.

[[Achroteth]] explains that [[Gnarl Bloodclaw|Gnarl]] is dead, upsetting [[Rorick]] who now has to find a new way to attract the crowds that their champion would draw in. When he explains that he is considering a deal with [[Laundithas]] to have the Automatons fight in the arena, rather than people, so that no one gets hurts and hopefully reduce the negative attention from the town, the adventurers dissuade him from signing it believing that [[Laundithas]] must be working with the [[Neighbourhood Watch]].

To show his appreciation, [[Rorick]] gives the party a pouch with 240gp and a small chest which [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] opens to find a pair of Redcap boots and a Redcap hat attached to the head of [[Raddicus]].

Deciding that it is time to leave, the adventures head out. [[Achroteth]] searches for [[Byll & Teadd]] with [[Fawn]] and [[Lullaby]], and [[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] searches for [[Rinji]] and [[Felgan]]. With a majority of the spectators starting to depart for the evening, [[Achroteth]] easily finds [[Byll & Teadd]] at the bar being hassled by some redcaps. With [[Lullaby]] and [[Fawn]], they convince the pair to give up their green cloaks and resign from their positions within the [[Neighbourhood Watch]]. The roommates agree, citing that [[Irbaron]] was just an angry person and even though they would no longer be receiving any of the protection money that [[Irbaron]] shared with them, they  confidently expressed that they would easily find work.

Neatly folding their cloaks and putting them aside, [[Lullaby]] sets them alight and the Redcaps bother the pair no more now that they are not wearing green cloaks.

[[Cedrick Deerfoot|Cedrick]] locates [[Rinji]] standing over the corpse of [[Felgan]], looking rather pleased with the outcome of his time with her.

Now they just need to find [[Dorgle]] so they can get back to [[Petalwood]].
