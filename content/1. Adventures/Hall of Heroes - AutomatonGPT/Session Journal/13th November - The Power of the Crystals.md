## Session Overview 
 
**Starday, 6th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**


Nimbleflick takes a brief pause, ponders, and answers Fawn's question.

"According to legend passed down through the generations of Quicklings, it is said that many millennia ago, a comet of pure starlight collided with Calindor. This cosmic event was so intense that the force of the impact created so much pressure that it fused stone into crystals imbued with its celestial magic. The same magic that flows through the veins of all Fey, blessing us with our gifts.

These crystals flow in intricate veins beneath the surface, like a complex web, linking the realms with a flow of raw, magical energy. 

This magic is bound to the delicate balance of Calindor’s nature because it weaves together elements, physics, and even the essence of magic itself. Tampering with these crystals can alter the very reality of Calindor. As you've just witnessed time was easily disrupted within the room by just a small splinter.

This is a much guarded secret though, for fear that someone may try to manipulate the crystal for destructive purposes.

When the Eladrin first arrived in Calindor, they heeded the warning from the indigenous fey. They signed a contract to only disclose the power of these crystals to the ruler of the realm and defend Calindor from those that seek to use the power for evil.

And defend Calindor they did, valiantly and many times.

Grommok Bloodrager.
Aurzath.
From Tyr, when he used your uncle, Thunderhead, to gain control from within.

There is of course the rumor that the plague that recently ravaged the Eladrin, was caused by a group of Fey bent on eliminating all non-Fey in Calindor.

So please, your highness, keep this secret guarded."

Revealing this information, gives the party a lot to think about.

Nimbleflick uses this moment to experience the memory taken from Lullaby, a memory previously lost to Lullaby. A memory of a time years ago, a time of innocence and a yearning for knowledge. A younger Lullaby is sprawled on the floor, surrounded by books, all open at one page or another and in all different languages. Lullaby is currently enthralled in a book,  face buried deep within the world that the author has created. Not able to make out exactly what the book is about, the young Lullaby picks up the book, closes it and kisses the cover of this treasured possession, catching a glimpse of the title, "The Cosmic Battle."   

A touching memory.

Achroteht follows up about what the Quicklings would require as part of an ongoing trade for the depleted crystals.

Nimbleflick agrees to trade one pound of the gems for one ounce of holy water that has been blessed by the power of the Night of the Silent Choir.

Achroteth recalls that during his time studying the skies, the Night of the Silent Order is a rare event tied to the movement of  the lunar bodies.

The group wake and interrogate the unconscious green cloak, with Cedrick and Lullaby healing the tied up foe. Dorgle takes the cloak off him and Lullaby burns it.

As they leave with their prisoner, Nimbleflick gives each of them a depleted crystal, roughly the size of a golf ball.

On the way out, the adventurers chat to Tizzik, who is excited to learn that Nimbleflick is ok. The Quickling informs them that two other miners had exited the cave and taken one of the carts back to town. 

Achroteth requests Tizzik release the previously captured intruder. They put the pair of prisoners into the cart and make their way to Petalwood.

Dorgle, as menacing as ever, tortures and intimidates the Green Cloak, placing the Changeling head on his chest. Cedrick does his best to prevent Dorgle from escalating the situation any further.

Meanwhile, Rinji is stuck into his book, trying to learn more about his potential destiny. The pictures catch his eye, and his focus is drawn to an image of the True Champion standing in front of a cave entrance, above is six constellations all lined up in a direct line, emanating a beam of light down onto the cave.

He asks Achroteth about celestial alignments and if the stars lining up is possible and shows me an image from his book. Achroteth recognises the similarities of these constellations to others he is familiar wityh, as if they are the same but different, unable to determine for sure.

A bump in the road flicks the book to a page about the author of the book, Venelien Swiftbranch.

Arriving back to town and the group notice a buzz in the air, as the townsfolk moving along the streets with a sense of excitement in each step.

They strategize what to do first now they have arrived, and as the conversation turns to their prisoners Dorgle rather loudly exclaims that they should dispose of the bodies, drawing the attention of the some of the villagers as they pass by.

Attempting to draw their attention away from him, Dorgle summons his Echo and  shouts “Murderer” causing a commotion on the busy street. Achroteth immediately hops off the cart, heading to see Althea, Rinji and Lullaby follow closely behind.

Cedrick jumps out, heading to the Town Hall, leaving Fawn and Dorgle to deal with the consequences of Dorgle's antics.

---

At Bake it to the Limit, a flour spackled Althea cautiously hurries Achroteth, Lullaby and Rinji into her back office and they recall the events that have taken place. 

Although vexed that Nimbleflick has broken protocol, Althea realises that the situation requires finesse so as not to reveal the powerful secret.

Achroteth shares that the plan to organise a trade agreement, Althea confirms that it may be the best solution, if the Quicklings trade with the blacksmith, the taxes from selling the gems should be enough to distract the council from looking any further but cautions that they must act fast as there are currently multiple permits granted to the townfolk.

Achroteth reveals that all the Quicklings want for the stones is holy water that has been blessed by the power of the Night of the Silent Choir. Althea  mentions that perhaps Brother Varrus might know of where or how to get some and that the hermit should be arriving in the next day or so to pick up some his supplies as he regularly does.

They head to the Town Hall, rushing to halt all mining operations.

---

Dorgle, seeing some of the Neighbourhood Watch approaching the cart thinks quick and bribes the still conscious miner with his new gem.

When the Green Cloaks ask Dorgle about what is going on, he spins a tale about a group causing problems and that he was fulfilling his civic duty and bringing them back for the own safety.

The Green Cloak escorts them all to the Town Hall, stating that the council will definitely want to hear about what has happened as there had already been reports of miners being attacked.

---


Cedrick arrives at Town Hall and sparing no time for small talk, heads past Glendelle and into the Council Chambers.

He shares the story of the incident in the Quickling Cave, the altercation with the group of Green Cloaks that were there to mine and the power of the crystals transforming one of them into a crystalized abomination of their former selves.

This peaks the interest of the Mayor, Scribe and Purser, seeing the potential in this new discovery.

Achroteth, Rinji, Lullaby and Althea arrive at the council chambers hearing Cedrick give his account of the events while trying his best to not reveal the scale of the power they found.

Achroteth tries to persuade the council to halt all mining operations, warning them that it will cause problems for the Quicklings.

The greed of the council members is infuriating to Achroteth who yells at the council, demanding they stop the mining before someone get's injured  or worse.

Althea proposes that the council should cease all mining activities until they have had a chance to discuss the information presented and make an informed decision.

---

Dorgle and Fawn pull up to the Town Hall in the cart with their escort and their captives. Walking through the doors of the Town Hall, they are greeted by a group of Neighbourhood Watch who stare at them as they enter the Council Chambers as well.








As Nimbleflick paused to weigh his answer, he held Fawn’s gaze, a flicker of something ancient in his small, sharp eyes.

“Your Highness,” he began softly, his voice almost reverent. “Legend speaks of a time when a comet of pure starlight cleaved its way through the heavens and struck Calindor, embedding itself in the very bones of the land. Its fiery descent brought more than mere light—it brought a power raw and unbridled, a force that seeped into the stone and crystalized within, woven with the energy that lives in all Fey. Those crystals, those veins of stardust, now lie tangled beneath us like the delicate roots of an ancient tree, linking our world to realms far beyond.”

He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.

“But this magic isn’t just power; it’s part of the balance of Calindor. It touches everything: earth, air, water, and even the rules that govern magic itself. To meddle with these crystals, to tear them from their place, would be to risk unbinding reality itself. You felt it in that room—the slightest splinter, and time itself shifted.”

A quiet intensity filled his voice. “This knowledge has been guarded, hidden in the heart of the Fey for eons. When the Eladrin arrived, they pledged to honor our covenant. They vowed that the secrets of the crystals would only be shared with Calindor’s sovereign, and they fought to protect it with a loyalty as fierce as any oath. They defended it from tyrants like Grommok Bloodrager, from Aurzath, and from those who, like Tyr, sought to control it from within. They defended it, even when it nearly broke them.”

He hesitated, a rare vulnerability passing over his face. “There are whispers that the plague which ravaged the Eladrin was no accident, that it was seeded by those who wanted to see all non-Fey purged from Calindor.”

A chill passed over the party as Nimbleflick turned back to Fawn. “Guard this secret, Your Highness. The future of Calindor depends on it.”

The party fell silent, absorbing the weight of Nimbleflick’s tale. In that moment, Nimbleflick took advantage of the silence, reaching into the fractured memory he’d taken from Lullaby—a memory once lost to him. It was years ago, back in the gentler days of youth. A young Lullaby lay sprawled on a floor scattered with books, his eyes tracing lines of words in languages he didn’t yet understand. His focus locked on one particular book, gripping it tightly as he leaned close, captivated. Slowly, reverently, he lifted the book to his lips, pressing a kiss to its cover, his eyes catching the faded title: _The Cosmic Battle._

A glimmer of innocence, and a moment of wonder.

Achroteth’s voice broke the silence as he turned to Nimbleflick. “And what, if anything, would the Quicklings ask in return for these crystals?”

Nimbleflick nodded, considering the question. “One pound of crystal, for one ounce of holy water, blessed beneath the Night of the Silent Choir.”

Achroteth’s brow furrowed as he recalled his studies, recalling a rare lunar event calling forth energies he had not yet fully grasped.

The party awakened their unconscious prisoner, a Green Cloak still reeling from his capture. Cedrick and Lullaby tended to his wounds as Dorgle, expression shadowed, slipped the prisoner’s cloak off his shoulders, a faint smirk crossing his face as Lullaby ignited it.

As they prepared to leave, Nimbleflick handed each of them a depleted crystal as a token of appreciation.

Outside, they encountered Tizzik, who nearly vibrated with relief to know that Nimbleflick was unharmed. In hushed tones, Tizzik shared that two other miners had fled to town with one of the carts. At Achroteth’s request, Tizzik released another captive encountered earlier. Together, they loaded the prisoners and set out for Petalwood, the weight of their discoveries pressing down as much as the cart’s worn wheels against the rocky path.

The journey back was tense, Dorgle’s menacing tone unnerving the still-conscious Green Cloak, especially when Dorgle placed a changeling’s severed head onto his chest. Cedrick worked quickly to calm the situation, easing the prisoner’s fear as best he could. Meanwhile, Rinji was lost in his book, tracing illustrations of celestial alignments, his gaze lingering on an image: the True Champion standing before a cave, framed by six constellations aligned, light streaming down upon him. The sight kindled something within him, a sense of destiny.

Curious, he showed the image to Achroteth. Achroteth studied it, the constellations both familiar and yet somehow foreign to him—a tantalizing enigma.

As the cart jolted along the road, Rinji’s book fell open to a page featuring the author, Venelien Swiftbranch.

Back in Petalwood, the townsfolk seemed alight with anticipation, the murmur of voices swelling with each step. The group discussed their next move, debating how best to handle their prisoners. Dorgle, in a voice that brooked no opposition, spoke of disposing of the bodies. His words caught the attention of passing villagers, and, thinking quickly, he summoned his Echo, shouting “Murderer!” to divert their suspicion.

Achroteth, Rinji, and Lullaby used the commotion as a chance to slip away, heading to Althea’s bakery, Bake it to the Limit. Althea, covered in flour, ushered them into the back, her face a mix of exasperation and concern as they recounted their discoveries.

Althea’s expression tightened as she processed Nimbleflick’s breach of protocol but nodded at Achroteth’s proposal. “If the Quicklings trade through the blacksmith, and the town taxes the sales, it might keep the council from probing too deeply. But we’ll need to act quickly—permits are already out.”

Achroteth mentioned the Night of the Silent Choir, and Althea’s eyes sharpened. “Brother Varrus might know more about that. He’s due to come by soon for supplies.”

With no time to waste, they made for the Town Hall to interrupt the discussions on what to do about the still missing Sheriff Elrohir and halt the mining operations.

---

Meanwhile, Dorgle spotted a member of the Neighbourhood Watch approaching the cart and quickly bribed the miner beside him, passing her one of the depleted crystals. When questioned by a Green Cloak, Dorgle spun a tale of civic duty and threats to public safety. Seemingly satisfied, the Green Cloak escorted them toward the Town Hall, promising the council would want to hear the story.

---

Inside the Town Hall, Cedrick wasted no time with pleasantries, striding past Glendelle and into the council chambers. He recounted the events in the Quickling cave, the crystalline transformations, and the danger that lay hidden beneath their town. His words ignited a glint of greed in the eyes of the Mayor, Scribe, and Purser.

Achroteth, arriving just in time, struggled to contain his frustration, his voice rising as he demanded the council halt the mining before anyone else suffered. Althea, sensing the need for diplomacy, proposed a pause on mining until a measured decision could be reached. The council, their eyes narrowed with calculations of profit and power, agreed, for the time being.

---

Moments later, Dorgle and Fawn arrived with their captives in tow, drawing the gaze of the Neighbourhood Watch as they entered. The council chamber felt thick with tension as the adventurers faced the council, the weight of the Fey’s secrets hanging over them all, and an uncertain path stretching before them in the shadowed heart of Petalwood.
