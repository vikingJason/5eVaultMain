## Session Overview 
 
**Starday, 6th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

The magical pulse sends a shockwave through the late night streets of Petalwood. Rinji uses the bright and momentary distraction to slip away from Lullaby and Dorgle to continue pursuing his target, like a hungry Owlbear stalking it's prey.

The panicked noises of the townsfolk overwhelm Rinji's senses and the trail starts to go cold. Rinji pushes on, searching frenetically until he catches a glimpse of the Greencloak entering a house. Rinji sneaks around, looking for a window to get a better view of what is going on inside. He uses a crate to try and climb up, but it falls apart under the weight of the Kobold, hitting the ground with a loud thud.

Rinji does not give up, he approaches the front door peering underneath. The gap is just big enough for Rinji to see the moving shadows cast by the inhabitants and hear only their hushed voices talking about something that he can't make out.

His curiosity growing and determined to get inside, Rinji finds an open window and quickly clambers up. Inside the dark room furnished with a small bed and wardrobe, Rinji presses his ear against the closed door. He hears the scared couple talking, unsure of how they will get by or feed their child. They discuss the possibility of leaving Petalwood and finding a better place for them to live, but self doubt starts to surface as they face the fact that they are not permitted to leave.    

Realising that there is not going to be a worthy fight, Rinji sneaks back out the window. The wind begins to stir and sparks Wild Fey Magic start to swirl before fizzling out.

He arrives back to the Troll's Tollbooth and is stunned to see that the rest of his group are congregating in Achroteth's room. He immediately senses that something is not right with his brother, noticing the Druid staring into the oblivion as if his gaze was focussed on one tiny star in  a galaxy of many constellations. Unable to figure out what is afflicting Achroteth, Rinji decides to stay by his side overnight and opens his book to continue learning about his destiny.

Dorgle, Fawn and Cedrick head to bed, while Lullaby falls asleep clinging to Achroteth whose gaze has not shifted.

Struggling to concentrate, Rinji's slowly drifts off to sleep without being able to move past the first page he opened to, learning that there are multiple factions that are constantly at play trying to stop the Guardians.

One particular faction stands out, a radical cult who worships the crystals as deities themselves, believing that the Guardians are sent as scouts to locate the Shimmering Cave so that the True Champion can destroy it and obliterate the realm into nothingness.

**Elday, 7th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

4 Days Until the Unity Festival!

In the morning, the scent of a delicious breakfast is a welcome aroma, rousing the party from their slumber.

Achroteth slowly comes to terms with his crisis, needing privacy to continue to process the weight of it all he asks Lullaby and Rinji to leave his room. He then collects all of his shed scales from the floors, hoarding them in a small pouch that he hides on himself. 

The sounds of footsteps ascending the stairs announces Martha bringing breakfast for the weary adventurers. Rinji and Lullaby ambush the hospitable inn keeper, taking the trays from her full hands and start stuffing their faces with the food meant for the entire group.

Cedrick, belly rumbling, goes downstairs to a scene starkly different than the one last night. The common room is full of people, jovial villagers enjoying the generous spread, flowing drinks and great conversation.

Dorgle, looking for an opportunity to sow some chaos, spies a table with a trio sitting and talking quietly, paying little attention to the rest of the patrons. Dorgle pulls up a chair and joins them uninvited, trying to provoke them but the only reaction is from some of the nearby patrons who nervously eye the interaction going on. 

Achroteth leaves his room, silently moving down the hall towards the stairs. As he steps over Lullaby and Rinji, Lullaby tries to grab his tail but just misses, and the crumb faced duo quickly follow Achroteth.

Downstairs, Achroteth tells Martha that the bedside table is broken, offering to pay for it's replacement as a way to make amends.

At their reserved table, the group begin to discuss how they will spend the day. Rinji eagerly shares that he wants to return to the Quicklings, hiding his revelation that the Quicklings' cave is somehow connected to the Shimmering Cave. Lullaby reminds them all that the council session will start soon and that they should speak with the council members to gather more information and support Finroth's plan.

Committed to his antics, Dorgle pays for a drink, handing Martha the coins without haggling with her, triggering a small surge of Wild Fey Magic  that spawns a golden acorn. Still scared from the events of the previous evening, some of the patrons exit the tavern, leaving their drinks and their conversations unfinished.

Dorgle pushes his luck further with Martha, offering to pay more than what was asked, still in violation of the rules of realm. Another pulse of Wild Fey emanates from Dorgle, and as the bright flash subsides he finds that his Dwarven beard is replaced with a beard of flowers.

The remaining patrons rush out the door, infuriating Martha who can see the only option she has is to charge Dorgle double for everything.

Before they can cause any more trouble, the party set out on their way to complete their tasks at hand. The sun shines brightly in the morning sky, adding an welcoming bath of warmth to the lively streets. Making their way to Bake It To The Limit to speak with Althea, the group notices that there are hardly any Automatons around and the Neighbourhood Watch patrols are more frequent.

Arriving at the bakery, a haggard looking Althea emerges and apologises for the lack of delicious treats. She explains that her ovens became inoperable after the Wild Magic surge last night, much to the disappointment of Lullaby.

Lullaby and Achroteth gauge Althea's opinion of the Mayor as they discuss his request. After careful consideration, Althea is comforted by what Finroth is attempting to do. She reveals that the current form of governance is ineffective which is why the Fey would never have considered Democracy as is here. She agrees that a single leader can make the righty decisions quickly and if they overstep their powers, a unanimous decision from the council can remove them from office.

Althea shares that Finroth came from humble beginnings, he knows the hardships that the Petalwoodians would be going through, and that his intentions are noble, so she agrees to raise the article first thing at their meeting.

Scoring a victory, the party make their way to the artisans shops to look for Thalaniel, the People's Representative. They find him with an armed Neighbourhood guard and approach, requesting to speak privately. Achroteth and Lullaby are ushered to one of the nearby workshops while Rinji, Cedric and Dorgle prevent the Greencloaks from entering.

Achroteth and Lullaby proceed to raise the concerns of the town and people with Thalaniel, determined to understand why he would allow the innocent to suffer and struggle as they do. Thalaniel exclaims that he has tried to institute reforms to help, but could not get his ideas passed through. He shares that  during the Desolation, everyone was suffering and the Automatons were meant to be a way to alleviate the town's struggles. The manual labour could be done safer and more efficiently, generating more revenue that would benefit the entire town. 

Outside, Dorgle and Rinji have found the means to entertain themselves. They have engaged in a game of fantasy, imagining themselves as great powerful wizards, using sticks they found on the ground as makeshift wands and roleplaying scenes of arcane battles.

Achroteth and Lullaby continue their questioning, looking for specific details on the allocation of Automatons throughout the town. Thalaniel confirms that there are:
- 217 Automaton currently in operation within Petalwood.
	- Of those, 20 are owned by the town.
- 16 farms
	- Of those, the 6 largest and best yielding farms are operated solely by Automatons
- 7 Artisan stores that are owned and operated by people
- 11 Artisan stores that are owned by 5 businesses, operated solely by Automatons
- A number of other merchants and services

Saying this all out loud for the first time, Thalaniel comes to a disturbing realisiation. He agrees that Finroth could make the right decisions for the people of town and will support him, if the Mayor could agree to bring all the Automatons under council control so that the wealth they generate all belongs to the town and can be distributed equitably.

With little time before the Council session begins, Dorgle and Rinji finish their game and join Cedrick, Achroteth and Lullaby on the walk to town hall. They quickly exchange pleasantries with Glendelle and enter the library, interrupting the Lilareth while she is reading. The Scribe puts the book down on the seat beside her as the party try to garner her support.

The methodical Council member is not as hasty to agree to granting emergency powers. Achorteth pleads with her, citing that many of the individuals are suffering while a small few are flourishing, an imbalance that must be reconciled. She opens the town charter and bi-laws, referencing that as per Article 6, Section 1, Sub-Section A, "The Council of Petalwood shall, from this day on until its dissolution, be compelled in their duties to benefit the  interests of the township of Petalwood." 

Not unconvinced, Lilareth confirms that the laws can be changed but there would need to be overwhelming reason before she can commit her support.

Dorgle and Rinji start to  search the bookshelf, each with their own hidden agendas.

Achroteth and Lullaby ask Lilareth to consider that the most of the recent troubles in town can be tied back to Neighbourhood Watch, showing that change is needed. Lilareth again references the leatherbound tome, explaining that Irbaron as Sheriff-in-Absentia can make the decisions he sees fit to maintain order and that if he is removed as part of the council session, the new Sheriff can make the necessary sweeping reforms.

Unsure if their words have swayed Lilareth, Achroteth asks about having quotas for the Council, ensuring that there is fair representation. Lilareth contemplates, agreeing that a diverse council could be a better council, but there would need to be strict guidelines for how this would be enacted and wants to know how Finroth would plan to achieve all of this.

An excited and desperate Lullaby excuses himself, hopeful that he can find the Mayor in the Council Chambers and elicit his aid.

Unsure of what the strange symbols on these books mean but certain his intuition never lets him down, Dorgle takes one of the books from the shelf.

Rinji enquires if the shelves hold any books on the Shimmering Cave. Lilareth smiles at the request, inquisitive as to why anyone would want a book about legends and myths told to children as bedtime stories before retrieving a hardcover book titled, "The Origin Stories of the Shimmering Cave."

He signs a slip, confirming that he will:
- Ensure that he take no action to, nor through inaction allow, damage the book
- Return the book within 3 days
- Do not deface the book in any way

The pulse rippled through the darkened streets of Petalwood like the toll of a distant bell—quiet at first, then crashing over the town in a wave of trembling energy. Windows rattled in their frames, and faint screams punctuated the night. Rinji felt the shockwave reverberate through his small frame, but it wasn't fear he felt—it was opportunity.

The Kobold moved like shadow and smoke, vanishing into the chaos with the practiced ease of someone who understood how to live unnoticed. The pulse, that fleeting burst of light and sound, had given him what he needed: a distraction. Ahead, his quarry—the Greencloak—slipped through the streets, a blur of movement that ignited something primal in Rinji. It wasn’t just a hunt; it was instinct, the kind of pursuit that made an Owlbear’s blood run hot. Prey didn’t escape, not when Rinji was this close.

But Petalwood was alive with panic. The cries of townsfolk surged around him like an avalanche of sound, swallowing his senses. He lost the trail, momentarily disoriented, and a flare of frustration threatened to cloud his focus. No, Rinji thought, narrowing his eyes. He wasn’t done. He never gave up.

Then, just as despair began to creep in, he saw it: the faint movement of a cloak disappearing into the doorway of a modest house. His heart raced. He crept forward, his mind working to keep the noises of the town at bay. The door shut, but Rinji was nothing if not resourceful. Circling the building, he searched for another way in. A window perhaps? He spied one, just within reach. Finding a crate nearby, he pulled it under the sill, only to have the wood give way beneath him. He hit the ground with a crash that echoed in the quiet night.

The sound churned his gut, but it didn’t stop him. He wasn’t a coward, nor was he someone who let small failures define him. On hands and knees, he slithered to the front door and peered under the tiny gap between wood and stone. A faint sliver of light revealed shadows moving within. Voices, too hushed to decipher, spilled through the space, and though his ears strained, they caught nothing more than fragmented murmurs. Frustration burned, but curiosity burned hotter.

It took minutes—long, patient, calculated minutes—but he found another way. An open window on the building’s far side. This time, there were no shortcuts. Using his claws, he pulled himself up and through. Inside, the room was small and dark, the air stale. A bed and a wardrobe stood against the far wall, modest furnishings for a modest home. Pressing his ear to the door, Rinji caught the voices again, clearer now. A man and a woman, their tones laced with fear and weariness.

“They’ll never let us leave,” the man said, his voice trembling.

“And what happens if we stay?” the woman replied. “Starving in Petalwood doesn’t seem much better.”

“I can talk to Irbaron, surely he can be reasoned with.”

The words swirled around Rinji. These weren’t conspirators, nor threats. They were just people. Ordinary people, desperate and powerless. His sharp curiosity dulled. This wasn’t the fight he was looking for. He slinked back through the window, his tail flicking as he landed softly outside.

Then, as if the world itself responded to his discontent, the wind picked up. It whispered through the trees, carrying with it the faint glow of Wild Fey Magic. Sparks crackled in the air around him, dancing like fireflies caught in a storm, but they faded almost as quickly as they’d appeared. Rinji stared at the empty space they left behind for a long moment, then turned back toward the Troll’s Tollbooth.

When he arrived, the sight that greeted him sent a chill down his spine. The rest of the group had gathered in Achroteth’s room, the atmosphere heavy and strange. Achroteth sat at the center, his gaze distant, unseeing. Rinji had seen the druid’s connection to the natural world manifest in myriad ways, but this was different. It wasn’t peace that filled Achroteth’s expression, but something deeper, more unnerving. It was as if he were staring into an endless expanse, his mind fixated on a single star, dwarfed by the infinity around it.

“Brother?” Rinji’s voice was quiet, tentative. He stepped closer, studying Achroteth’s face for any sign of recognition. None came. Something was wrong. Achroteth, the unshakable druid, had been shaken.

Unable to decipher the affliction, Rinji resolved to stay by his brother’s side. As the others—Dorgle, Fawn, Cedrick—retired for the night, Rinji settled next to Achroteth. He pulled out his book, the pages filled with cryptic knowledge that always seemed to speak directly to his soul. Tonight, though, the words weighed heavy. He barely managed to turn a page before his eyes grew heavy, his mind lingering on a particular passage.

The book spoke of factions—forces that worked tirelessly to manipulate, to destroy, to preserve. Among them, one stood out: a radical cult, worshippers of the very cave that gave power to the Guardians. To these zealots, the Guardians were but tools, scouts searching for the fabled Shimmering Cave. The cult believed that if the cave were found and its power unleashed, it would bring the realm to an end, reducing it to nothingness.

Rinji’s mind churned with the implications as sleep finally claimed him. Outside, the wind stirred again, but the Wild Magic did not return. Petalwood’s night grew still once more, though the secrets it held lingered, waiting for dawn to reveal them.

**Elday, 7th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Four Days Until the Unity Festival!

Morning arrived in Petalwood with an unexpected serenity. The sunlight crept lazily through the cracks in the shutters, painting streaks of gold across the weary faces of adventurers still tangled in the last vestiges of sleep. And then came the smell—warm, savory, enticing. It wrapped around the senses like a whispered invitation. Breakfast was ready, and it wasn’t asking politely.

Achroteth stirred, though the scent of food was the least of his concerns. His crisis still lingered, heavy and pervasive, like a storm cloud that refused to dissipate. His thoughts spiraled, wrestling with truths he had yet to fully articulate even to himself. Eventually, he sat up, his movements deliberate, his breaths slow. He turned to Lullaby and Rinji, his voice low but firm, asking them to leave. It wasn’t cold, nor dismissive—just the raw honesty of someone who needed space to rebuild the foundation that had cracked beneath them.

Left alone, he moved through the quiet room, his gaze falling on the fragments of himself scattered across the floor. His shed scales. One by one, he collected them, his hands meticulous as if each piece held a part of his identity he wasn’t ready to lose. The pouch he concealed them in felt heavy against his chest as he tucked it away—a secret even from his closest companions.

The quiet broke with the sound of footsteps on the stairs. Martha, ever the diligent innkeeper, arrived with breakfast. Trays balanced precariously in her hands, her face wore the kind of resolute patience earned only through years of dealing with adventurers. Before she could even set foot in the hallway, Rinji and Lullaby ambushed her. Trays disappeared from her hands, replaced by the delighted squeals of a Kobold and a Kenku stuffing their faces with wild abandon. Whatever dignity the meal had been intended to carry was utterly lost.

Downstairs, the inn was alive, and Cedrick was greeted by a scene utterly transformed from the previous night. The common room now buzzed with energy. Villagers filled the tables, their laughter mingling with the clink of mugs and the rich aroma of breakfast. Whatever tensions had gripped them before seemed momentarily forgotten, buried beneath the warmth of companionship.

Dorgle, naturally, sought the quietest corner of the room—if only to disrupt it. A trio of villagers sat at a table near the wall, speaking in low tones, their heads bent close together. They paid little mind to the noise around them, which made them perfect targets. Dorgle slid into an empty chair at their table without invitation, his grin wide and toothy, his words dripping with provocation. The villagers ignored him, but others in the room took notice. Nervous eyes darted toward the interaction, their unease palpable.

Meanwhile, Achroteth descended the stairs in silence, his movements precise, his presence almost spectral. As he stepped over Lullaby and Rinji, sprawled in the hall like two satiated cats, Lullaby reached out instinctively, his hand brushing just shy of his tail. The duo scrambled to their feet, crumbs still clinging to their faces, and followed him like mischievous younger siblings.

Downstairs, Achroteth found Martha and offered to have it replaced. Achroteth’s offer wasn’t about the table—it was about balance, about righting the small chaos he could control.

The group reconvened at their table, their talk shifting to the tasks ahead. Rinji, ever the opportunist, spoke eagerly about returning to the Quicklings. He didn’t mention the connection he’d discovered between their cave and the Shimmering Cave, guarding that revelation like a secret weapon. Lullaby, always the voice of focus (or perhaps just practicality), reminded the group that the council meeting loomed and that Finroth’s plans needed allies if they were to succeed.

But Dorgle wasn’t finished with his morning antics. He purchased a drink, his usual haggling conspicuously absent, and handed over the coins. The act—small and seemingly innocuous—triggered a spark of Wild Fey Magic. A golden acorn materialized in the air before him, spinning lazily before clattering to the table. The room grew still, the silence heavy. Patrons began to leave, their unease from the previous night reawakening.

Dorgle, undeterred, doubled down. He handed Martha more coins for the bedside table he broker, grinning as if daring the universe to react. And react it did. Another surge of Wild Magic burst from him, and when the light faded, his once-proud Dwarven beard had been replaced with a riot of flowers, their petals soft and fragrant. The remaining patrons fled in earnest, and Martha’s patience snapped. She pointed a finger at Dorgle, her voice sharp. “Double. You’ll pay double for everything from now on.”

Before further trouble could brew, the party decided to take their leave. The sun greeted them outside, bright and warm, its light dancing across the cobblestones of Petalwood’s streets. The town seemed livelier now, though the absence of Automatons and the increased patrols of the Neighbourhood Watch didn’t go unnoticed.

Their first stop was Bake It to the Limit. The bakery’s familiar scent was absent, replaced by the faint tang of ash. Althea greeted them, her face drawn, her eyes heavy with exhaustion. She apologized for the lack of treats, explaining that her ovens had been rendered useless by the surge of Wild Magic the night before.

As they spoke, Lullaby and Achroteth carefully steered the conversation toward the Mayor. Althea hesitated at first, but the group’s sincerity won her over. She admitted her frustration with the current system of governance. Democracy in Petalwood, she explained, lacked the structure and unity it needed to truly succeed. Finroth, however, was different. She saw in him the kind of leader who understood hardship and bore the resolve to make difficult choices. “He knows what it’s like to struggle,” she said, admitting that kind of empathy is rare and if he falters, the council can act.

Her resolve solidified, Althea promised to introduce the proposal for granting the Emergency Executive Powers to Finroth at the meeting.

The party left the bakery with a renewed sense of purpose, though the day’s challenges still lay ahead. Above them, the sun climbed higher, its warmth a fleeting comfort against the uncertainties that awaited.

After the party successfully gains Althea’s support, they turn their attention to Thalaniel, the People’s Representative. Determined to secure another ally for Finroth’s proposal, they venture into the artisan district in search of him.

Achroteth's massive frame led the group through the maze of workshops and storefronts of Petalwood’s Artisan Quarter. The weight of the conversation ahead hung heavy between him and Lullaby, who skipped at his side, humming an unfamiliar tune with a too-wide grin. It wasn’t joy—Achroteth had come to know that grin as a mask she wore when ready to dismantle someone with words.

Their quarry wasn’t hard to find. Thalaniel, the People’s Representative, stood near a shop, flanked by a Greencloak guard. His eyes carried a haunted look, the telltale mark of someone whose ideals had been battered against the rocks of reality. Achroteth and Lullaby approached with deliberate strides, their presence commanding enough that Thalaniel’s shoulders visibly tensed. 

Thalaniel exchanged a glance with the guard, then nodded reluctantly, motioning toward an adjacent workshop. The door creaked shut behind them, leaving Rinji, Cedric, and Dorgle to block the Greencloak from entering.

Outside, Dorgle was already bored. His keen eyes scanned the ground, settling on a gnarled stick. Moments later, he and Rinji were locked in an epic arcane duel, their "magic" crackling in their imaginations as their sticks clashed. Cedric, leaning against the wall nearby, tried and failed to stifle a laugh and studied the Golden Acorn. Despite the absurdity, their antics eased the tension for all present. Even the Greencloak guard, standing stiffly nearby, occasionally glanced at the pair with something approaching amusement.

Inside, Achroteth leaned against the workbench. Lullaby perched himself on a stool, legs crossed, his ever-present smile a weapon waiting to be unsheathed.

The pair raised the concerns of the town and people with Thalaniel, determined to understand why he would allow the innocent to suffer and struggle as they do. 

Thalaniel flinched, the weariness in his voice showing signs of frustration. He exclaims that he had tried, he had proposed reforms, subsidies for farmers, fairer distribution of resources, better wages, but the council was constantly in a deadlock where nothing gets passed and nothing changes.

Lullaby’s smile didn’t waver, but his eyes narrowed. Achroteth tilted his head slightly, studying the man, demanded answers about the Automatons. Thalaniel explained that during the Desolation, people were starving. Seeing  light at the end of the tunnel, the council agreed on using the Automatons because they could work without rest, could harvest crops, build homes, repair infrastructure, and generating more revenue that would benefit the entire town. And they did.

Achroteth and Lullaby continued their questioning, looking for specific details on the allocation of Automatons throughout the town. Thalaniel confirmed that there are:
- 217 Automaton currently in operation within Petalwood.
	- Of those, 20 are owned by the town.
- 16 farms
	- Of those, the 6 largest and best yielding farms are operated solely by Automatons
- 7 Artisan stores that are owned and operated by people
- 11 Artisan stores that are owned by 5 businesses, operated solely by Automatons
- A number of other merchants and services

Thalaniel looked down at his hands, calloused from years of hard work, and as if someone had finally unmasked his eyes for the first time he saw it staring at him, the realisation that the wealth the Automatons generated didn’t flow to the people the way he thought it should have.

Lullaby stood up and Achroteth pushed off the workbench, encouraging the council member to make his voice heard for the people he claimed to represent. Thalaniel nodded, his face a mixture of determination and exhaustion.

As the party left the workshop, Dorgle and Rinji were mid-duel, their imaginary battle growing ever more elaborate. 

The air in Petalwood felt heavier than usual as the group made their way toward the town hall. Dorgle and Rinji lagged behind momentarily, their mock arcane battle coming to an anticlimactic halt as Cedrick cleared his throat.

Glendelle, ever watchful, greeted them as they approached. Her sharp gaze softened briefly when she saw Cedrick but returned to its usual edge when addressing the rest. The pleasantries were swift, and soon they entered the hall.

The scent of parchment and ink greeted them as they entered the library, the grand vault of Petalwood’s knowledge. Shelves stretched from floor to ceiling. At its heart, Lilareth sat in quiet repose, her back straight and poised as always. Her hands rested on a book, its pages yellowed with age but its edges immaculately crisp.

She looked up as they entered and closed the tome, carefully placing it on the chair beside her. Achroteth wasted no time, his deep voice reverberated in the quiet library, trying to garner her support for Finroth’s proposal to grant emergency powers.

Lilareth’s gaze sharpened, though her hands remained folded in her lap warning that emergency powers are not given lightly. She rose, crossing to the towering bookshelf, her fingers glided along the spines until they landed on a weathered, leather-bound volume. Pulling it free, she laid it open on the table before her.

“Article 6, Section 1, Sub-Section A,” she read aloud, her voice taking on a clipped, formal cadence. “‘The Council of Petalwood shall, from this day on until its dissolution, be compelled in their duties to benefit the interests of the township of Petalwood.’” She snapped the book shut and turned her gaze to the group, challenging them convince her that these emergency powers would be used to serve the people before she would commit her support.

As Achroteth and Lullaby pressed their case, Dorgle and Rinji’s attention wandered. The towering bookshelves called to them, though for vastly different reasons.

Achroteth and Lullaby leaned forward, and asked Lilareth to consider what the Neighbourhood Watch has become a tool at the beck and call of the Sheriff-in-Absentia, tied to many of the recent troubles in town rather that it's protection.

Lilareth listened, her expression unreadable. Her fingers tapped lightly on the cover of the book before her. “Irbaron does have authority, under the charter, to maintain order as he sees fit,” she said. “If he is removed during this session, then yes, his successor could enact reforms. But those reforms must be precise. Sweeping changes without structure will only lead to chaos.”

Achroteth nodded slowly, understanding the unspoken warning in her words and asked for the Scribe's opinion of  instigating quotas for the council so that it better reflects the diversity of the town. Lilareth’s eyes softened slightly, she knew a diverse council could be a stronger council, and cautioned that such a system would need strict guidelines. She demanded to know what exactly Finroth proposed.

Before Achroteth could answer, Lullaby stood abruptly, his usual mask of mischief slipping to reveal genuine urgency, to go find Finroth. His footsteps echoed as he disappeared down the hall, heading for the Council Chambers.

Dorgle’s eyes narrowed as he scanned the strange symbols that he couldn’t quite understand. He ran his fingers along the spines, relying more on instinct than intellect. A particular book caught his eye—a small, unassuming volume bound in cracked green leather. He pulled it free, his brow furrowed as he flipped through its pages. Though the words were incomprehensible, his gut told him it was important. He tucked the book into his satchel.

Rinji, meanwhile, moved with purpose. “Do you have anything on the Shimmering Cave?” he asked, breaking the lul in the conversation between Achroteth and Lilareth.

Lilareth tilted her head, intrigued and clarified that she heard Rinji correctly because the Shimmering Cave was nothing more than a legend told to children.

He confirmed that the council member had heard correctly. 

Her lips quirked into the faintest smile. She disappeared into the shelves, returning moments later with a dusty tome titled The Origin Stories of the Shimmering Cave. She handed it to Rinji and presented him with a slip of parchment to sign.

He carefully scrawled his name beneath the terms:
- He would take no action to, nor through inaction allow, damage to the book.
- He would return it within three days.
- He would not deface the book in any way.

Satisfied, Lilareth handed him the book.

As the remaining party members gathered their thoughts, Dorgle clutched his stolen book tightly. He had no idea what the strange symbols meant, but something about it felt… right. He didn’t need to understand it yet. His intuition had rarely failed him before.

Rinji, meanwhile, cradled the borrowed tome, its weight both literal and figurative in his hands. He couldn’t help but wonder what truths or fictions it held about the Shimmering Cave. If Lilareth thought it was mere myth, then why did the book feel so… significant?

The hour loomed, heavy with possibility. Decisions would be made, alliances tested, and perhaps—just perhaps—Petalwood’s fate would take a turn for the better.
