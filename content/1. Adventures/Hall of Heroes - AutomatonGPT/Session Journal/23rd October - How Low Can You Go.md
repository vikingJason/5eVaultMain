## Session Overview 
 
**Starday, 6th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

As the day drew on and Cedrick’s impatience mounted, the humdrum task of standing guard over the carts grew intolerable. Determined, he headed down into the twisting tunnels of the Quicklings' lairs, the flicker of the luminescent crystals casting long shadows as he found his companions deep within.

Achroteth and Cedrick, ever cautious and keen for the truth, examined the parchment bearing the miners’ permit. They scrutinized it, piecing together the arcane wording that revealed this was merely a Temporary Exploratory Permit—enough to permit holders the privilege to survey the site and claim no more than a scant ounce of gemstone, sufficient only for testing and validation. Woe to any who would dare take more than allowed, for the contract held magic within its ink, a protection that would see the thief punished by the very terms they broke.

Approaching the nearest of the men, Achroteth squared his shoulders and issued his warning to leave. Scared, the miner turned to flee, and Achroteth’s gaze narrowed, his fingers tracing a quick sigil in the air. With a whispered word, the spell took hold; the man’s limbs froze mid-flight as Hold Person gripped him, rigid as the stone walls around him. Deciding it safer to bind the miner, again Achroteth warned the man that the Quicklings will not hesitate to kill them should they trespass further.

Deeper they ventured, coming to a fork in the labyrinthine tunnels. There was a strange silence here, a muffling of sound that made each footstep fall heavily. After brief consultation, the group veered right, the tunnel narrowing as the air grew colder. It was here that Dorgle, with a snarl and a glint in his eye, charged ahead, his stride fierce and swift. The next hallway revealed another mine, who stood poised over a pressure plate embedded in the stone floor, his foot hovering. It seemed that stepping on the stone plate would trigger the sound of grinding stone. 

The party confronted the brother, and, to their relief, their words reached him. The man’s face drained of color as he heard of the Quicklings’ ire, and he turned, leaving swiftly to rejoin his brother.

The plate on the floor still a mystery, the group investigate further, trying to learn it's secrets. Listening closely, they detected faint sounds—a distant scrape, echoing as though from both the path before them and behind. They moved forward into another chamber, where another pressure plate awaited, the air thick with the promise of hidden magic.

Beyond lay yet another room, this one home to a massive crystal that hung from the roof like a chandelier, its fractured planes catching the light in eerie glimmers. The sight of a floating pick axe, rope and bucket indicating that perhaps magic has been used to create some mischief. 

Cedrick cast Detect Magic. The crystals pulsed, a subtle glow suffusing their cores revealing to Cedrick that these crystals are indeed magic and that once removed from the rock, the crystals’ connection to the magic severed, yet they retained their nature as conduits.

Delving deeper, they reached a fourth pressure plate and at last, a stone door, rough-hewn but covered in intricate carvings. Four concentric rings adorned the portal. Stepping onto one of the plates, Lullaby felt the shift as one ring rotated, locking for a moment before resetting, a puzzle as old as the mountain itself.

They spread out, each testing the plates, pressing and coordinating, intent on discovering the door’s secret. 

Dorgle, impatient and brash, moved into the chamber dominated by the large crystal. As he approached, a strange sensation overtook him—a tug at his being as his feet left the ground. Gravity abandoned him, and he rose, floating through the air, his fingers stretching towards the crystal. The instant he touched it, a low hum thrummed through his body, resonant and deep, and he felt its ancient energy vibrating within him.

His eyes caught a fracture in the crystal, a hairline crack that seemed almost deliberate. Looking around, he spotted a small shard, and, with careful hands, set it into the crystal’s wound. As it fit into place, the room’s strange enchantment faded; his feet found the ground once more.

Their minds sharpened by purpose and their hearts drumming with the thrill of discovery, the companions resumed their work. Each took their place, hands at the ready, their gazes locked in silent accord as they synchronized their steps upon the pressure plates. Stone ground against stone, a rumble low and deep as the ancient door began to shift, rolling open with a reluctant groan, before the mechanism shuddered to life once more, slowly beginning to close.

Understanding dawned in a shared glance. Timing was everything now, they stepped back onto their plates, the door groaning open just enough once more. In a heartbeat, they dashed, bodies taut and breath held, slipping through the narrowing gap, hearts pounding as the stone sealed behind them with a resounding thud. They were through—only by a fraction—but it was enough.

Beyond lay another chamber, shrouded in shadows and waiting to reveal its secrets.
