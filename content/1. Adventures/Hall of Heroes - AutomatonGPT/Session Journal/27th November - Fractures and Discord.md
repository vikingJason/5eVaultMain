## Session Overview 
 
**Starday, 6th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**


The Council is still in session, discussing the mining operations underway when Fawn and Dorgle enter the chambers, escorted by members of the Neighbourhood Watch.

Fawn springs on to the offensive, denouncing the councils actions and for letting harm come to the Quicklings in the mines. Mayor Finroth tried to explain and defend his actions, but Fawn would not back down from her stance.

Finroth asked the witness her account of what had transpired. Nervously, the Petalwoodian shifted her gaze from Dorgle to the mayor, and confirmed that the Greencloaks had attacked them and killed the other miners. She shares the gemstone she claimed she acquired from the mine with Finroth as per her Exploratory Mining Permit.

Fawn and Achroteth seize the opportunity to strengthen their case that the Neighbourhood Watch should be overhauled, or even disbanded and that Irbaron must be removed from his position as the Sheriff In-Absentia. Fawn presses Finroth further, dictating that townsfolk are suffering and the council need to reflect on their decisions and the true cost of them.

In baited breath, the party watch for Finroth's response. His face awash with concern and contemplation. He concedes that their words and actions have moved him and decrees the council will have a closed door meeting to discuss these grave issues first thing in the morning and decide on the fate of Irbaron's position and the Neighbourhood Watch.

One of the Greencloaks in the council chambers, draws his hand to his sword hilt and in a huff of rage storms out. Rinji quickly follows. Lullaby and Dorgle chase after Rinji.

Satisfied that change in on the air, Achroteth, Cedrick and Fawn leave the town hall.

---

Eager to provide an update on her Royal Duties, Fawn heads to see the E-Mail Server and send a note to Ness. She pens her message, sharing that the Royal Gala has been combined with a Unity Festival, and requests that Glitterfall send enough table and chairs for all the guests.

Fawn pays the 2cp fee to have the E-Mail sent, but does so without bartering.

At that moment, a surge of Wild Fey Magic explodes covering most of the town. 

---

Lullaby and Dorgle stalk through the streets to catch up with Rinji and then the Greencloak. Dorgle, making a game of it, by switching positions with his Echo back and forth.

Too much fun leads them to giving away their intentions as the Greencloak stops to turn and face them.

Suddenly a giant shockwave of bright light and Wild Fey Magic rushes through the street.

---

Cedric and Achroteth head towards the edge of town.

Finding a secluded spot fair enough away to not be seen, Achroteth unleashes his dragon breath into his empty gemstone.

As his magic fills the crystal, a light inside starts to glow. Dim at first but as Achroteth focuses, the illumination strengthens and the light projects a star chart on the trees around them.

A large surge of Wild Fey Magic explodes out from the centre of town.

---

Fawn is told that it seems like all E-Mail Servers are down, and that as soon as it is restored her message will be sent.

Fawn soon realises that her connection to the Divine power from Sehanine has been severed, deducing that this is more than likely a result of the her not following the rules.

She heads to the tavern as quickly as possible, trying to avoid any questions or blame.

In the streets, people are starting to panic. Raised voices as they try to find answers slowly turns to shouting blame at one and all. 

She soon finds herself on a street with an Automaton, standing in the middle of the path not moving and hunched over itself. It is surrounded by a mob of townsfolk taking out their frustration on the lifeless construct.

---

As the bright light fades, Dorgle and Lullaby turn to see that Rinji and the Neighbourhood Watch they were following had used the distraction to get away.

Dorgle searches for his echo, and when it can't be found he tries summoning it again. Inextricably, Dorgle finds himself unable to summon his best friend.

Lullaby is also concerned that he is not able to draw on his magical abilities.

They continue through the streets towards the Troll's Tollbooth, meeting up with Fawn, the mob, the Automaton, and the sounds of a group marching in unison towards them.

---

Making their way back to town, Achroteth offers to use his magical breath to jump start Cedrick's crystal core if it needs it. 

An intrigued Cedrick respectfully declines, wanting to study the magical crystals further and infuse his own magic into it. They agree to trade the already infused crystal for the inert one, so that Cedrick can examine it when they get back to the tavern.

As they walk and talk, Cedric also notices some of Achroteth's scales have lost their lustre and are now matte.

They arrive at the intersection where Fawn, Lullaby and Dorgle standing before the group of townsfolk trying to push over the dormant automaton.

From further down the street, a dishevelled looking Irbaron leads a formation of the Neighbourhood Watch to disperse the crowd and enforce a curfew. To Fawn's surprise, the acting Sheriff warns the Greencloaks to ensure that they do not harm the princess. 

Fawn intervenes and after listening to the plight of the struggling townsfolk, she convinces them to disband and go home, and that she will do all that she can to bring about change for the betterment of their lives.

A begrudging Irbaron thanks Fawn before barking orders to his troops.

The party continue on to the tavern, arriving soon after.

A concerned Martha hurries them inside and is glad that they are ok. Sitting at the table in the empty inn, Achroteth magically produces some Goodberries while everyone else stares in disbelief. 

Lullaby, Dorgle and Fawn explain that they have lost their magic connection. Fawn takes responsibility for her actions, bringing on the criticisms of Lullaby and Dorgle.

As the group prepare to go to bed, there is a knock at the door stopping everyone in their tracks. Martha unlocks the door, and after a few words with the hooded figure standing in the doorway she welcomes them inside. Mayor Finroth removes his hood and says that he wishes to speak with us. 

He thanks the adventures for all they have done and apologises for the mining fiasco. Achroteth assures the mayor that they know it is not his fault, stating that it was the explorers who overstepped their bounds.

This springboards Finroth into a confession of his dissatisfactions about the council. He concedes that he has had growing concerns of their ability to make the right decisions for the people of Petalwood and that some no longer serve the interests of the town at all. 

As Finroth continues, he reveals that there is a clause in the Town Charter that can grant the mayor Emergency Executive Powers, allowing them to make decisions without the need to rely on the Council's vote. He requests that they help him to have the Council grant this emergency power so that he can take immediate action and enact the laws needed  to help the people of Petalwood.

Initially unsure, they agree to assist but with certain conditions.

Fawn shares her observations that many people are struggling and it seems to have a connection to the arrival of the Automatons. Learning that only 15% of the townsfolk own Automatons, Achroteth appeals to Finroth that it is not fair that they are benefiting so much that the rest of town is drowning. Fawn dictates that a referendum be held on the use and ownership of automatons.

Finroth also agrees to request that a limit is placed for how long the emergency powers can be granted for.

Achroteth demands that  better Fey representation is needed on the council, and that at least two Council Positions are to be reserved for Fey and at least two Council Positions are to be reserved for non-Fey.

With all sides in agreeance, Finroth suggests that they need to convince at least two other council members to introduce the request fearing that if he does it himself, it will look as though he is trying to assert control and the plan may fail. Fawn asks who on the council should they approach, Finroth recommends that they do not breath a word of their plan to Aelarion, stating the Purser currently has a vested interest in the money the Automatons bring into town. He shares that Althea would likely be sympathetic to what they are trying to achieve given the struggles that the Fey have undergone.

Finroth confirms that he is unsure of the remaining council members, but leans towards having more success with Lilareth as Thalaniel's brother in law, is the cousin of Irbaron.

As their business concludes, Finroth heads to the door to leave, fiddling with the pendant on his necklace. Noting the fascination Finroth has with the pendant, she asks Finroth about it. He pauses a moment and for the first time that anyone can recall, a wave of emotion flashes over Finroth's face as he  mentions it was a gift from his wife before excusing himself to attend to the matters at hand.

The weary adventures head to their rooms for the evening.

In his room alone, Achroteth removes his shirt and notices that his scales have started to shed and are replaces with matte black scales. Filled with anger,  he smashes the bedside table to splinters and lets out a pained roar.

Lullaby knocks on Achroteth's door, concerned and trying help - no reponse from Achroteth. Martha comes upstairs to see what is going on. Lullaby tries to convince her to open the door but Martha refuses.

Fawn comes out of her room and tries to look under the door but can't see much through the tiny gap. Cedric emerges from his room, seeing Lullaby with his mace raised above his head and Fawn laying on the floor assists  and picks the lock.

Lullaby kicks the door open, charges in and rather than grapples Achroteth in a tight hug.

#### **The Council Chambers: Discord Sown**

The council’s chamber was a battleground—not of swords and spells but of words. Mayor Finroth, seated with a regal weariness, presided over a tense debate on the mining operations. The air bristled with unease, like a storm on the cusp of breaking. Into this charged atmosphere stormed Fawn and Dorgle, their arrival as sudden and disruptive as thunder. The Neighbourhood Watch escorted them, their presence drawing sharp gazes from the council members.

Fawn wasted no time. Her words cut through the room, sharp as a blade drawn in anger. She denounced the council’s decisions, accusing them of negligence that had led to harm befalling the Quicklings. Finroth’s measured reply was no match for Fawn’s fervor. Her voice, tinged with righteous fury, did not falter.

A witness was brought forth. The woman’s eyes darted nervously between Dorgle and the mayor as she recounted the attack by the Greencloaks. Her hands trembled as she presented a gemstone, mined at great personal cost, as evidence. Finroth studied it with a troubled gaze, the weight of responsibility settling heavier upon his shoulders.

Sensing the moment, Fawn pressed harder, her voice a rallying cry for reform. Achroteth joined her, the cadence of his speech measured but forceful. Together, they demanded the overhaul of the Neighbourhood Watch and the removal of Irbaron as Sheriff In-Absentia. They continued their message that the people of Petalwood are suffering and that it is time the council reflects on the cost of their decisions.

Finroth’s reply came not with words but with an expression that betrayed his inner turmoil. Finally, he nodded, decreeing that the council would deliberate on the matter behind closed doors the next morning. Change was on the horizon, but not everyone welcomed it. A Greencloak, his face dark with anger, stormed out, hand on the hilt of his sword. Rinji followed swiftly, concern etched on his features. Dorgle and Lullaby moved to pursue, the tension thick.

---

Fawn, eager to fulfil her royal duties, visited the E-Mail Server to send a message to Ness in Glitterfall. Her request for tables and chairs for the Unity Festival seemed mundane, yet to Fawn this was proof that she could make her parents proud and become a Queen befitting the legacy left before her. 

As she handed the E-Mail Server the fee to send the message she soon realised her mistake. 

Fawn has not bartered, breaking one of the tenets of Calindor, a surge of Wild Fey Magic exploded, rippling outward like an unseen tide.

---

Dorgle and Lullaby followed the Greencloak through the streets of Petalwood, their pursuit playful at first, with Dorgle’s Echo flickering in and out of sight. But their quarry, sensing their presence, turned to confront them. Before words could be exchanged, the street was bathed in a blinding shockwave of light—Wild Fey Magic unleashed in a moment of raw power.

---

On the outskirts of town, Achroteth and Cedrick found solace in the quiet. Achroteth, his breath a weapon honed by years of control, filled an inert gemstone with his draconic power. The light it emitted was faint at first, then grew into a galaxy of constellations, projected onto the trees like a glimpse into the heavens. But their reverie was cut short by the same surge of Wild Fey Magic engulfing most of the town, its light turning the night into day.

---

As the shockwave subsided, Fawn’s was met with troubling news: the E-Mail Servers were down.

Worse, she felt a severing, a disconnection from the divine power of Sehanine. Guilt clawed at her as she hurried through streets where panic was brewing. The raised voices of the townsfolk as they try to find answers slowly turned to shouting and finding someone to blame for all their troubles.

She stumbled upon a dormant automaton surrounded by an angry mob. The townsfolk’s frustration found an outlet in the lifeless construct, their shouts a symphony of despair.

---

As the cascade of light dissipates, the street comes back into focus. Dorgle and Lullaby stand in the eerie silence, their quarry—Rinji and the Neighbourhood Watch—nowhere to be seen. The distraction had given their prey just enough time to slip into the shadows, leaving behind only the faint rustle of disturbed leaves and the lingering echo of hurried footsteps.

Dorgle narrows his eyes, stepping into the space where his echo should have been. He reaches for the tether, willing it into existence with the ease of years of practice, but his hand grasps at nothing. A cold weight sinks into his chest as realization dawns—his echo, his constant companion, is gone. He tries again, desperation seeping into his voice, but the magic refuses to answer.

Beside him, Lullaby clenches his fists, attempting to draw on his own arcane reserves. He feels the familiar pull, the thread of power just out of reach, but it fizzles, refusing to coalesce. His expression tightens, frustration mingling with unease. Whatever had caused the burst of magic, it had severed their connection to the forces they relied upon.

The two press onward, weaving through the increasingly chaotic streets. Their path leads them toward the street where Fawn stands before a restless mob circling a hunched Automaton. Its still frame looms like a ghost of progress, immobile, but now a lightning rod for the townsfolk’s anger. The sound of synchronized footsteps echoes from the distance—a steady, ominous rhythm of a group marching toward them.

---

On their journey back to town, Achroteth offers to use his magical breath to jump-start Cedrick's crystal core, should it require a surge of power.

Cedrick, intrigued but cautious, politely declines. He expresses a desire to study the magical crystals further, planning to infuse his own magic into them. They strike a compromise: trading the already infused crystal for the inert one, so Cedrick can examine it in detail later at the tavern.

As they walk, Cedrick notices something peculiar—some of Achroteth's scales have dulled, their once-brilliant sheen replaced with a matte finish.

Their path leads them to an intersection where they find Fawn, Lullaby, and Dorgle standing firm before a restless mob of townsfolk, who are attempting to topple a dormant Automaton. Shouts of frustration and the creak of strained metal fill the air as the crowd’s desperation builds.

From further down the street, Irbaron appears, disheveled but determined, leading a formation of the Neighbourhood Watch. Their synchronized march cuts through the chaos, a stark reminder of authority. To everyone’s surprise, the acting Sheriff warns the Greencloaks in no uncertain terms: no harm is to come to Princess Fawn.

Fawn steps forward, her presence commanding attention. Listening to the anger and despair of the struggling townsfolk, she addresses them with a calm yet impassioned tone. Her words carry hope, promising them she will do everything in her power to bring about meaningful change. Gradually, her sincerity breaks through their fury. With murmurs of reluctant agreement, the mob disbands, shuffling back to their homes.

Irbaron watches the scene unfold, a begrudging respect flickering in his expression. He offers Fawn a curt thanks before barking orders to his troops, dispersing the remaining stragglers and enforcing the curfew.

The party continue their way to the tavern, their minds weighed by the events of the evening, their steps heavy with exhaustion. They arrive shortly after, greeted by Martha showering them with a flood of hospitality and relief. 

Seated at the table in the dimly lit, empty inn, Achroteth surprises everyone by magically producing a handful of Goodberries. The rest of the group stares in stunned disbelief.

Lullaby, Dorgle, and Fawn exchange worried glances before explaining that they’ve lost their magical connection. Fawn, burdened by guilt, takes responsibility for the actions that led to this predicament. Her admission draws criticism from both Lullaby and Dorgle, their frustrations bubbling to the surface.

As the tension settles, the group begins preparing to turn in for the night when an unexpected knock at the door stops them in their tracks. Martha, ever cautious, approaches and carefully unlocks it. After exchanging a few words with the hooded figure standing outside, she steps aside to let them enter.

The visitor lowers his hood, revealing Mayor Finroth. His expression is solemn as he announces his intention to speak with the group.

Finroth begins by thanking the adventurers for their efforts, particularly their work with the mining crisis. He apologizes for the fiasco, though Achroteth quickly assures him that the blame does not rest with him but with the explorers who overreached. This reassurance seems to embolden the mayor, who shifts to a more candid tone.

He expresses growing dissatisfaction with the Town Council, revealing his belief that some members no longer act in Petalwood’s best interests. Finroth then divulges a clause in the Town Charter: under specific conditions, the mayor can be granted Emergency Executive Powers, allowing decisions to bypass council votes. He requests their assistance in convincing the Council to grant him these powers, asserting that it would enable him to make the swift changes necessary to aid the struggling townsfolk.

The group hesitates, wary of granting such authority, but eventually agrees on the condition that safeguards are put in place.

Fawn speaks up first, emphasizing the hardship faced by many townsfolk since the arrival of the Automatons. Learning that only 15% of the population owns these constructs, Fawn pieces together that it is creating a stark divide. Achroteth supports her, arguing that it’s unjust for a small minority to prosper while the rest of the town suffers. They propose that a public referendum be held on the use and ownership of Automatons.

Finroth agrees and also consents to placing a strict time limit on the emergency powers to prevent abuse.

Achroteth then raises another point, demanding better representation for the Fey on the Council. He insists that at least two positions be reserved for Fey and another two for non-Fey to ensure balanced governance. Finroth nods in agreement, acknowledging the importance of inclusivity.

With terms established, the discussion shifts to strategy. Finroth cautions that introducing the request himself might be perceived as a grab for power and suggests enlisting the support of at least two council members. When asked whom they should approach, Finroth advises avoiding Aelarion, the Purser, who profits significantly from the Automatons. Instead, he recommends Althea, who understands the true struggles of the Fey. Trying to decide between the remaining members, he proposes Lilareth  might  be more amenable over Thalaniel due to his ties to Irbaron through marriage.

As their conversation concludes, Finroth prepares to leave. On his way out, he absently fiddles with a pendant hanging around his neck. Fawn, intrigued, asks about it. For a moment, an uncharacteristic wave of emotion crosses his face. Finroth softly explains that it was a gift from his late wife before excusing himself to tend to his duties. The door closes quietly behind him, leaving the group to head to their rooms and reflect on the weight of the day’s revelations.

---

In his room, Achroteth stared at his reflection, rage bubbling as he saw his scales—once a testament to his draconic heritage—shedding to reveal matte black replacements. His roar of anger shook the room.

Concerned, Lullaby knocked on the door but was met with silence. Cedrick picked the lock, and Lullaby charged in—not to fight, but to embrace Achroteth in a gesture of solidarity. Their struggles were far from over, but for a moment, amidst the darkness, there was a flicker of light.
