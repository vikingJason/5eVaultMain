## Session Overview 
 
**Starday, 6th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

After the group hug is released, the adventurers set out towards the large tree where Ellywick said they found the gemstone. Engrossed in his newest discovery regarding his destiny, Rinji rides on his shoulders and reads his book.

With the midday sun beating down on them as they travel the road outside of Petalwood, the group spot a cart pulled by horses  approaching from town. As it draws closer they see that the cart is being driven by a member of the Neighbourhood Watch, with three more Green Cloak passengers and the glints of sunlight revealing they mining tools on board.

The cart passes by without stopping and the adventurers pick up  the pace.

A short time after they spot another cart travelling on the road from Petalwood, this time driven by the pair that were spotted getting mining permits at the town hall and also carrying mining tools on board.

They eventually arrive at the trail that leads deeper into Shimmerleaf Woods, finding evidence that the carts that passed by on the road also turned off the road here. Trekking deeper, the trees start to thicken and it is apparent that travel by cart at this stage would prove difficult but not impossible, and the canopy above providing a nice dense shade from the sun.

Lullaby and Achroteth get a sense that something seems off the closer they get to their destination, Lullaby noting that the energies tied to his magical abilities and the magical forces of Calindor are being affected but is unsure by what or how.

Observing the forest around them beginning to change, the hue of the sky shift and the leaves taking on vibrant colours, Achroteth casts a spell to cover their approach and sneak undetected towards a clearing where they see both carts but none of the passengers.

In the middle of the clearing stands a magnificent Oak Tree with a trunk that stretches so wide, the adventures need to turn their head to see it all. As they admire the roots that twist and knot into a beautiful pattern around the base of this stellar tree, they spot something moving at incredible speed between the carts, the trees and the bushes.

Deducing just as swiftly as the creature moves that it is a Quickling, Achroteth approaches the tree and tries to communicate with it. The Quickling introduces himself as Tizzik and questions the party, wanting to know why they are at his home and if they are just like the others that are in the tree and they shouldn't be.

Achroteth confirms that their intentions are noble, agreeing to help remove the intruders. Tizzik leads the party to the entrance of the Quickling den hidden within the intricate pattern of the twisted roots of the tree and tells them to find Nimbleflick once we get rid of the intruders but he must stay to keep watch. 

The path into the tree leads down into the earth and eventually the roots meld into stone and the party find themselves in a cave deep underground that opens to a massive chasm.

The cave is illuminated by a brilliant blue light coming from exposed crystals in the  ceiling and walls of the cave. Their only path forward is a rickety wooded bridge that crosses the deep dark chasm below.

Gallantly, Rinji crosses the bridge first, cautiously but makes it to the other side without an issue, convincing everyone else to do the same.

Heading further in, the path is blocked by the results of a cave in and have no choice but to enter a small cavity setting off some sort of trap as spears at hurled at them without warning. Thankfully the spears were just some sort of illusion, perhaps to ward off anyone from wondering deeper inside. Spotting a small gap in the wall and looking through to make sure it is safe, the adventurers witness a pair of miners being harassed by a Quickling.

Dorgle uses his shadow to sneak into the cave and start intimidating the miners, who are only pushed so far before they decide they need to defend themselves and they get into a fight.

Dorgle slays one of the miners and in fear the other tries to run off but is chased by Rinji. Achroteth and Lullaby squeeze through the gap in time to see Dorgle looting the body of the dead miner, which was only carrying some mining tools and a permit.

But if they only filled in the paperwork today how was it already approved? Something wasn't adding up ... then  it dawned on them. Finroth had said that he was relaxing all administrative requirements until the Unity Festival, but surely he didn't mean all requirements, just the ones for planning for the Festival ... right???
