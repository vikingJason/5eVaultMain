## Session Overview 
 
**Starday, 6th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

Fawn ventures down into the Quickling lair to join her companions, unaware of what has transpired. She is surprised to see Rinji standing guard over a hog tied miner. Rinji offers his explanations, but the sound of heavy stone grinding against stone draws them both deeper into the cave. They follow the noise just in time to see the rest of their party dash through a doorway that closes behind them.

Fawn and Rinji study the door, looking for a way through to join their companions. Impatiently, Rinji uses his brute strength to try and break through. At the same time, Cedrick uses the mechanism on the other side of the door to activate the mechanism to open it for his friends.

As the stone rings turn and the large door rises, Rinji boasts his accomplishment as he walks through. Fawns stares pondering the impossibility that Rinji's attack on the door was enough to open while the rest of the stare at Fawn wondering why she didn't join them.

Cedrick again opens the doorway for Fawn who regains her composure and heads through.

The group, reunited, make their way down the narrow passage to the sound of metal clanging against stone, and voices displaying surprise with each hit.

Dorgle scouts ahead, making his way to a large cave and spotting a group of Neighbourhood watch, wearing their identifiable green cloaks. They are all standing around a large crystal protruding from the wall at the far end of the cave and filling it with a brilliant blue light.. A frail looking Green Cloak, wearing glasses and holding a notebook, points to a spot of the crystal, indicating where the other members of the mining group should strike.

As the pick axe makes contact with the crystal, a small burst of magic pulses out and the group of miners appear to be moving at extreme speed. The chronicler looking surprised and pleased, indicates another target on the crystal. This time as the magic pulses from the stone, the Green Cloaks speed is slowed dramatically. Another precise strike on the crystal returns their speed to normal.

Excited, the Green Cloaks unbox an Automaton poised to assist with their mining operation. The mining is halted as Dorgle interrupts them, booming an order to stop immediately out across the cave. The rest of the party enter, trying to convince the Neighbourhood Watch that the home of the Quicklings can not be mined without their consent. To reinforce their attempts, Fawn uses her royal status to decree that it is even a protected area.

The lust for power is too strong, the note-taker slowly turns to face the object of his studies and suddenly grabs a pickaxe, raising it above his head. Seeing only trouble resulting from this, Achroteth is quick to action and utters an incantation in Druidic to try to hold the Green Cloak in place.

His spell is resisted and the raised mining tool meets the bright crystal. The magic pulse from the strike almost blinding. As it fades, surprise fills the room when they all see that Green Cloak that had struck the stone has transformed, still wearing the unmistakeable green cloak but their body morphed as if now it was made of the very same crystal.

Combat breaks out between the two opposing groups. The crystal adversary striking fear as it uses a shard of crystal snapped from its own skin to produce a spear that pierces harshly.

The protectors gain the upper hand in the fight, but the Automaton follows it's directive and strikes the large crystal in the precise location causing the magic of the stone to transform it a large crystal Automaton.

The group rally and press their attacks, Lullaby and Fawn calling upon Spiritual Weapons to aid their efforts. Dorgle employs the clever use of his Echo. Achroteth conjures the druidic powers within to magically enhance each of his attacks. Rinji's rage gives him to strength to resist the mighty blows he receives and return them in kind. Cedrick using his ingenuity to help control the battlefield.

Seeing their defeat soon upon them, one of the Green Cloaks rushes to strike the crystal blindly, chipping a small shard from it. The magic pulse is stronger than previously experienced, filling the whole room and distorting time uncontrollably.

The time distortion randomly altering the momentum and reflexes of each creature of the room, constantly changing their initiative order,  shifts the tide of the fight back and forth. The crystal Green Cloak begins to retreat but is delivered a devastating blow, shattering it to pieces. The intruders all begin to fall, with the Crystal Automaton the last enemy standing.

As it is weakens, each attack it receives causes sharps shards to fly out from it's body and piercing anyone standing near. Fawn draws on her divine powers and releases a fatal attack, shattering the crystal Automaton and releasing a final spray of crystal splinters that knock down Rinji and Dorgle.

With the fight over, Fawn and Lullaby aid Rinji and Dorgle to their feet, Achroteth moves to find the fragment and reunite it with the crystal in the wall of the cave in the hope of repairing the time field with Cedrick's help.

At the same time, a Quickling enters the cave moving sluggishly for a speedy Fey due to the time field distortion. He shares that he is Nimbleflick, the elder of the Quickling flash that inhabits the cave and demands answers.

After Nimbleflick learns that they are there to help and protect the Quicklings home, he shares his grave concerns that the townsfolk wish to mine the magic stones. He reveals that the crystals are tied to the fabric of the realm and that any disruption of the magic within can have dire consequences for Calindor.

Achroteth offers to broker a deal that will result in maintaining harmony for the crystals, the magic within, Petalwood and the Quicklings. Nimbleflick concedes that any gem that has fallen from the vein and is depleted of the magic inside can be traded for, but warns that the removal of the magic infused gems will not be tolerated.

Seeing a weapon that is too special to resits, Rinji takes the crystal spear that had been used to hurt him in  the earlier battle. An inspired Cedrick inspects the fragments of the shattered Automaton and grabs a few pieces that he is sure he can use to create his construct. 

As a token of goodwill for the potential bargain, Nimbleflick agrees that with the magical contracts in place as safeguards in exchange for something he longs for. Nimbleflick, never having experienced true love, requests the memory of true loves first kiss. Achroteth confesses that this is something he can not provide and enquires what else it will take to sustain a bargain with Petalwood. Nimbleflick pauses to think before he answers Achroteth, and Dorgle, Fawn and Lullaby offer their memories. 

As Nimbleflick retrieves the memories, he first experiences Dorgle's memory of an event taking place at that very moment, Dorgle embracing Shadow Dorgle and though it is self love, it is not an act of True Love. Dorgle stops what he is doing, with no re-collection of why he and his Echo are kissing.

Fawn's memory plays in his mind, a stolen moment in the Great Library of Glitterfall with Celly. The tension and nervous laughter shared between the two is cut by a series of awakening kisses and gentle caresses, a moment that brings bliss and warmth to Nimbleflick. Fawn stutters for a moment, as the joy of the heartfelt memory is taken from her, and returns to the matter at hand.

Before Nimbleflick can experience the memory from Lullaby, Fawn requests more information about the connection between the magic in the crystals and the fate of Calindor.

What will Nimbleflick and the Quicklings want? What will Lullaby's memory reveal?

So many questions left unanswered...






As Fawn descended into the Quickling lair, the light around her seemed to dim, swallowed by shadows that clung to the damp stone walls. She moved quietly, unaware of the tense silence that had settled over her companions. It was only when she reached the low chamber and saw Rinji standing over a hog-tied miner that she stopped short, surprise widening her eyes.

Rinji, sensing her gaze, offered a quick explanation, his voice calm yet guarded. Before Fawn could reply, a low rumble echoed through the cavern—a grinding sound of stone on stone, ancient and ominous, reverberating through the passageways like the growl of a slumbering beast. Their gazes locked, and without a word, they moved deeper into the lair, following the sound.

Ahead, their companions dashed through a stone doorway that sealed behind them, closing with a finality that left the two staring at the cold, unyielding door. Impatient as ever, Rinji set his jaw, muscles coiling as he slammed his might against the stone. Yet even his considerable strength barely dented it. Cedrick, on the other side, fumbled with the mechanism and the rings turning slowly, the stone door groaned as it rose.

Rinji, not one to forgo a boast, strode through with a smirk, as though his mere presence had done the trick.

Fawn's gaze lingered on the door, scepticism leading her to question the possibility that Rinji's attack on the door was enough to open the door as the rest of the group stare at Fawn wondering why she didn't join them.

Cedrick again opens the doorway for Fawn who regains her composure and heads through.

Reunited, the group moved forward, the narrow passageways channelling them toward a distant clang of metal against stone. Voices, hushed and fervent, echoed faintly, each syllable punctuated by gasps of surprise. Dorgle slipped ahead, vanishing into the shadows locates the source of the noise echoing through the cave.

The party crept into a vast cavern, where a small gathering of the Neighbourhood Watch stood, garbed in their familiar green cloaks. At the far end of the cave, a massive crystal protruded from the wall, its radiant blue light filling the chamber with an otherworldly glow. A thin, bookish man with spectacles and a notebook gestured excitedly, directing the miners with pinpoint precision. Each strike of the pickaxes sent a pulse of magic through the room, altering the speed of the workers—a trick of time woven into the crystal itself.

The miners shifted between blurs of motion and eerie stillness, like puppets on strings pulled taut and then loosed. Each strike, each pulse of magic, drew more power from the crystal, and with every surge, the frail chronicler’s satisfaction grew.

It was then that they revealed their true purpose: an Automaton, gleaming and ready to serve, stood at the ready, poised to mine the strange and powerful crystal. Dorgle's voice echoed through the cavern, stern and unyielding, demanding they cease. The others joined him, insisting that this was no ordinary cave, no simple mine to be plundered. Fawn, her voice rich with authority, invoked her royal status, declaring the cave a protected domain of the Quicklings.

But the chronicler’s greed flared in his eyes, his hand closing around a pickaxe as he turned slowly, transfixed by the crystal’s thrumming power. Achroteth, sensing the madness brewing, muttered an incantation, his voice like a low chant weaving through the rock. But the chronicler resisted, his arm raised high, and then the pickaxe struck the crystal.

Magic exploded in a blinding burst, as if the very air itself was torn and scattered into fragments. When their sight returned, they beheld a horror—a Green Cloak transformed, his form crystallized, limbs jagged, eyes blank and glittering with an unnatural light. A chill ran through the room as he tore a spear-like shard from his own body, its edges sharp and deadly.

The battle erupted. The crystal form moved with terrifying speed, wielding its spear with a merciless precision. Their strikes barely marred its surface, each hit seeming to echo through the crystal as shards splintered off, flying with lethal intent. The Automaton, under orders, struck the crystal, its own form morphing into a twisted, crystalline menace.

Fawn and Lullaby called upon their divine powers, summoning spectral weapons that flew toward their foes. Dorgle’s Echo danced and struck beside him, a mirror of his fury. Achroteth’s spells wrapped his strikes in the primal power of the wilds. Cedrick moved with precision, using every spell and tool at his disposal to shift the tide of the battle. Rinji, in his rage, struck again and again, his body enduring the brutal assault of shards that tore into his flesh.

As the tide of battle turned in their favor, one Green Cloak lunged toward the crystal, striking it blindly. The resulting burst shook the chamber, twisting the currents of time until each heartbeat felt like an eternity.

In the thick of the fight, time itself unravelled—a pulse from the crystal sent ripples through the cave, twisting moments out of sequence. A single strike seemed to take an age; another passed in an instant. The crystal Green Cloak’s advance slowed, then surged forward, like some living embodiment of the crystal’s fractured magic.

The Green Cloak’s crystalline form shattered under a final blow, scattering into pieces. Only the crystal Automaton remained, its strikes flinging shards with every hit. But at last, Fawn landed a decisive strike, shattering the construct. It exploded, sending a final spray of crystal into the air, cutting down Rinji and Dorgle.

As the fight ended, Fawn and Lullaby helped Rinji and Dorgle to their feet, Achroteth and Cedrick already at work attempting to mend the damage done. At that moment, a Quickling slipped into the cavern, moving with sluggish grace. He introduced himself as Nimbleflick, elder of the Quickling flash, his voice a mix of agitation and weariness as he demanded answers.

Learning of their intentions, Nimbleflick revealed the deeper truth of the crystal’s power—a force not simply mined, but bound to the realm’s very fabric. Any disturbance would threaten Calindor itself. Achroteth proposed a pact, one that would protect the crystal’s magic and maintain harmony with Petalwood. Nimbleflick agreed but demanded a token of goodwill: a memory of true love’s first kiss.

Achroteth hesitated, realizing he could not give what he did not possess. As he considered the cost, Fawn, Dorgle and Lullaby offered their own memories.

One by one, Nimbleflick received their memories. Dorgle’s, an event taking place at that very moment, Dorgle embracing Shadow Dorgle. An odd moment of self-love but not true love, confused Nimbleflick. Dorgle ceased what he was doing, with no re-collection of why he and his Echo had been kissing.

Fawn’s memory unfolded like a delicate painting—the Great Library of Glitterfall, the nervous laughter and stolen kisses shared with Celly bringing bliss and warmth to Nimbleflick. Fawn faltered as the memory faded, the warmth and joy of that moment slipping away, leaving her feeling hollow yet resolved to return to the matter at hand.

Nimbleflick paused,  preparing to experience the memory from Lullaby sensing the weight of what he had been given, but a curious Fawn requested further information about the binding connection between the crystals and Calindor itself. 

As the Quickling prepared to speak, questions lingered—What will Nimbleflick and the Quicklings want? What will Lullaby's memory reveal? How are the crystals tied to the fate of Calindor?
