## Session Overview 
 
**Elday, 7th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Four Days Until the Unity Festival!

Rinji takes an opportunity to seek out the town Apothecary Sylvaen, asking for a potion to induce a trance with which he can connect with his Kobold ancestors. She advises that she can make such a potion, but first requires her journal with all of the recipes she has gathered over the years to make the right tincture.

---

Fawn, Lullaby and Achroteth finish up with The Magnificent Constants and head over to Bake it to the Limit to continue making preparations for the upcoming Unity Festival. They discuss Althea setting up a stall at the festival to sell her treats, and the different ways to encourage the Fey to attend such as a Siege Bowl tournament.

Before leaving, Fawn requests help with repaying a favour to Thread, Tinsel and Thimble. Althea agrees to start preparing a batch of Glitter Cookies, their favourite, that Fawn could give to them.

Next stop for Fawn, Lullaby and Achroteth is Town Hall, where Fawn shares how her plans for the Unity Festival are progressing. Glendelle offers to assist, telling Fawn that they can use the template from previous festivals, providing some relief for the princess.

With some of the weight lifted off Fawn's shoulders, they return to The Troll's Tollbooth.

---

After inserting himself into a social interaction that he was not apart of nor invited to, Dorgle attracts the interest of Brother Varrus. Brother Varrus, intrigued, continues to ask questions about Dorgle's adventures before quickly deciding that their conversation would be better with a drink in hand.

---

Cedrick paused for a moment to study his initials that he had stitched into the small patch of cloth, pleased with how he had progressed with his embroidery. He decided to reward himself with a tasty beverage, and headed downstairs to common room of the tavern.

---

The tavern was not too busy this evening, thankfully Martha was able to drag tables together for the group and their guests to sit together and continue their lively discussions. Brother Varrus was eager to learn more of the interesting associates of Dorgle, eyes growing wider with each tale revealed as a boast of their abilities.

In the middle of the common room, Dorgle was not able to get the attention of Byll and Teadd so he slammed down the Changeling head trophy he held, right on to the table they all sat at. This caused a domino effect of patrons vomitting, with even poor Lullaby with an iron stomach not able to hold back their spew.

The conversation was steered to the goddess Sehanine, for whom Varrus was a devout worshipper. Fawn was keen to learn more about the ways of the goddess, showing Brother Varrus the brand on her hand, and revealing that Sehanine had told her that she was not thankful enough for her powers, and to seek out Brother Varrus.

Varrus admitted that he was not fortunate enough to have ever spoken with Sehanine, but he was concerned by what Fawn had described and shared that the only way to pray to the goddess was quite simple.

This sent Fawn spiralling as she meticulously replayed in her mind everything she had done over the past few weeks.

Cedrick grabbed the rotting head from the table, took it outside and burnt it to ashes. This caused a small surge of energy to course through Dorgle, adding to his confidence in his own strength.

Lullaby asked about the Night of the Silent Choir, and explained that in order to facilitate a trade they wanted 10 ounces of Holy Water blessed with the powers of the Night of the Silent Choir from Brother Varus in return he wants us to retrieve a sacred moonstone. Brother Varrus explained that the Night of the Silent Choir was a special event where the two moons of Calindor were Full.

In exchange for the Holy Water, Brother Varrus enlisted their help to retrieve a Sacred Moonstone from an ancient temple to assist with his religious rituals.

As the group considered the quest they discussed what other tasks they had to complete the following day.

Achroteth gathered Brother Varrus outside to negotiate the regular trading of the special Holy Water, to which Varrus agreed on the condition that he would receive a 50% discount on all items he purchased from the town.

Suddenly Fawn came to a startling revelation, she has never seen Sehanine and heard her speak at the same time. This concerning realisation caused Fawn to abruptly stands up and excuse herself from the table.

It didn't take long for everyone else to do the same.

Achroteth continued to work on his new attire.

Lullaby had a bath hoping it would be enough to start to feel better.

Rinji read a little more from the his destiny book, learning about the Feat of Dexterity.

Fawn prayed to Sehanine, questioning the voice she heard which only spurred more anger and harsh words.

**Moonday, 8th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Three Days Until the Unity Festival!

Everyone is woken from the sounds of Lullaby screaming up and down the hallway. Achroteth quickly looks at the green boils covering his ankles and uses his magic to detect that Lullaby is infected with a harmful parasite called Sarcovi. Achroteth calls on his magic again to aid Lullaby, who spits up a some small worm-like creatures that were the source of his ails.

Fawn runs downstairs to talk with Martha who is busy in the kitchen cooking because Galax, and a few other townsfolk, are unwell. Fawn deduces that it must be something in the water that is causing people to feel sick, as Achoteth joins them in the kitchen and confirms. Fawn rushed out into the dining room to collect the food and drinks from everyone tables before they can put anything in their mouths.

Martha was cynical at the thought of the water being the cause, as the dam north of town has a system for purifying the lake with the town's water. She does concede that something could have happened during the wild magic surge, and Achroteth casts a spell to purify the water that he was able to gather for the time being.

The group gather outside, and in the unusually quiet street discuss their plan. Fawn rushed off to town hall to tell Finroth about the water crisis and hold the auditions she had advertised.

As Fawn detailed her concerns about the town's water and the Sarcovi, Finroth was his usual calm self and explained that he had already sent some Automatons to inspect and repair the water purifiers. Fawn's suspicions grew as the mayor filled a glass with water and drank, stating matter-of-factly that this water was from a deep spring well on his personal estate and was of the finest quality.

Before leaving the council chambers Fawn asked about Finroth's pendant, observing in her interactions how the mayor would always be absent-mindedly tracing the pendant with his finger, as if each groove told a deeply personal story. A deep sadness washed over Finroth's face and he revealed that it was a gift from his late wife, Elara.

---

On the north side of town, Cedrick, Dorgle, Lullaby and Rinji arrived at the apothecary's residence. Rinji delivered the missing journal as part of his arrangement for the potion he sought.

In a surprise act of selflessness, Dorgle sold the flask of Rum Gremlin blood he still possessed to the apothecary, securing for himself some gold to hide his intention of seeking a treatment for the Lullaby's boils, causing a Wild Magic surge in the process.

Just on the outskirts of town they overheard a strange noise in the distance, as if hundreds of tiny feet were scurrying in their direction. They braced themselves for the worst as a pack of rabid squirrels attacked, frenzied and focussed on Dorgle.

After dealing with the squirrels, the path to the dam is a short one. A small shack with the door swinging open on one hinge and the scattered remains of a few automatons paint a scene of carnage and danger. Cedrick and Rinji entered the shack to an overwhelming wave of humidity, perfect for growing moss.

The sound of faulty gears, grinding and sputtering, drew the pair down a ladder into the underground system. The echoing intensified in the confined space and makes it difficult to hear anything. Looking ahead, Cedrick saw that the path forked left and right and knew that it was a wiser choice to have the rest of the party down with them.

With everyone in the tunnel, Lullaby provides some magical healing to Dorgle, who was bravely hiding that he had taken a beating from the squirrels earlier. Before Dorgle could thank Lullaby, a strange roar booms through the passageway, sending chills to the bones. From the shadows a creatures emerged. First glances confirmed it was an owlbear, known for it's brute strength and ferrocity, but something about this owlbear was off.

The creature inhaled, preparing to let out another bloodcurdling roar. But the sound it made was not what sent a shockwave of fear through their bodies, it was watching the owlbear's beak split open and strange tentacles reach out from it mouth toward them.











## Session

**Elday, 7th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Four Days Until the Unity Festival!

Rinji approached the apothecary Sylvaen with the quiet determination of someone walking a well-trodden but uncertain path. He wanted a potion—a tincture capable of inducing a trance deep enough to connect him with the voices of his Kobold ancestors. Sylvaen, a slight figure with silver-streaked hair and the unmistakable air of one who knew more than she let on, listened carefully. She promised she could craft such a concoction but admitted she lacked the key ingredient: her journal. A tome of faded pages and scribbled wisdom, it contained recipes gathered over decades. Without it, the tincture was impossible.

---

Meanwhile, Fawn, Lullaby, and Achroteth concluded their dealings with The Magnificent Constants and shifted their focus to Bake It to the Limit. The cozy bakery buzzed with the scent of spices and sugar, a haven of warmth in an often unkind world. Althea, the baker, stood behind her counter like a sentinel of sweetness. They discussed her setting up a stall at the Unity Festival, an event already straining under its many moving parts. As the conversation turned whimsical—Siege Bowl tournaments and Fey enticements—Fawn mentioned a lingering favor owed to the Fey trio Thread, Tinsel, and Thimble. Althea agreed to help, promising a batch of Glitter Cookies. Each cookie shimmered faintly in the warm bakery light, a quiet magic of its own.

The next stop was the Town Hall. Fawn’s burdened shoulders straightened as she met with Glendelle, who offered a template from past festivals to ease her planning. The relief in Fawn’s expression was fleeting, but noticeable. The weight of expectations hadn’t vanished, but it had shifted—just enough to let her breathe.

---

Elsewhere, Dorgle, with his uncanny ability to insert himself into conversations uninvited, captured the attention of Brother Varrus. The half-elf, tall and composed, studied Dorgle with an intensity that bordered on unsettling. He asked questions, probing not just for facts but for truths, as though Dorgle’s answers could reshape the world. Before long, Varrus suggested they move their discussion to the tavern, where such truths might flow more freely with a drink in hand.

---

Cedrick, in his quiet, contemplative corner, examined the initials he’d stitched into a patch of cloth. He smiled, a rare moment of satisfaction washing over him. Embroidery had taught him patience, precision. Rewarding himself for his progress, he headed downstairs to the common room of the tavern.

---

The tavern itself was unusually lively. Martha bustled about, dragging tables together to accommodate a growing group. The air buzzed with conversation, stories weaving together as Brother Varrus listened intently to tales of Dorgle’s companions. Each account brought a glimmer of fascination to his otherwise stoic face.

The conversation turned to Sehanine, the goddess Varrus worshiped. Fawn, eager yet uncertain, showed Varrus the brand on her hand, recounting a troubling encounter where the goddess had chastised her for ingratitude. Varrus, though devout, admitted he had never spoken with Sehanine himself. His unease was palpable as he explained the simplicity of praying to her, a revelation that left Fawn spiraling in self-doubt.

In a moment that shattered the tavern’s convivial atmosphere, Dorgle slammed a rotting Changeling head onto the table. The grotesque trophy triggered a cascade of nausea among the patrons. Even Lullaby, whose iron stomach was a point of pride, succumbed to the visceral reaction. 

Cedrick snatched up the rotting head and carried it outside to burn it, a surge of energy rippled through Dorgle. It was subtle but undeniable, feeding his ever-growing confidence.

---

The group’s discussion shifted to the Night of the Silent Choir, as Bother Varrus explained that it was an event where the twin moons of Calindor brightly shone in full splendor. Lullaby, with characteristic practicality, humbly asked Varrus for ten ounces of Holy Water blessed on that sacred night.

Varrus agreed, but only in exchange for retrieving a sacred moonstone from an ancient temple, appealing to their egos and pride.

Achroteth, privately secured an additional arrangement with Varrus—a regular trade of Holy Water in exchange for a lifelong 50% discount on town purchases. Varrus agreed, but the weight of these negotiations hung in the air like an unspoken promise.

Fawn, consumed by a growing unease, abruptly excused herself from the table. A realization clawed at her mind: she had never seen Sehanine and heard her voice at the same time. The thought unsettled her, sending ripples of doubt through her carefully composed exterior.

As the night stretched on, the group dispersed.

Achroteth meticulously worked on his new attire, threading symbolism and practicality into his craft.

Lullaby sought solace in a hot bath, trying to wash away the day’s nausea.

Rinji, with quiet resolve, returned to his destiny book, uncovering a passage about the Feat of Dexterity.

Fawn, in the solitude of her room, prayed to Sehanine, her words tinged with anger and frustration. The response that followed was harsh and offered no answers, only more doubts. Her dreams of a warm and caring embrace from Sehanine caused the princess more confusion, and the a restful sleep was all but impossible for Fawn.

**Moonday, 8th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Three Days Until the Unity Festival!

The morning erupted into chaos as Lullaby's screams pierced the stillness, jolting everyone awake. Achroteth, ever perceptive, was the first to notice the green boils spreading across his ankles. His magic flared to life, a golden light weaving through the air as he sought the root of the affliction. Sarcovi—he identified it grimly, a parasitic scourge. Acting swiftly, he summoned another burst of arcane energy, this time directed at Lullaby. The bard’s body convulsed, and moments later, a cluster of squirming, worm-like creatures spilled from his lips onto the floor, the source of his torment expelled at last.

Fawn, driven by an urgency only she seemed to feel, bolted downstairs to find Martha in the kitchen. The cook, sleeves rolled up and brow furrowed, stirred a pot with frustration written across her face. "Galax and half the town are unwell," Martha muttered. Fawn’s mind raced, connecting dots faster than anyone could follow. It had to be the water—nothing else made sense. Moments later, Achroteth joined them, confirming her suspicions with a nod, his magic once again revealing the truth.

"Everyone stop eating!" Fawn’s voice rang out as she burst into the dining room. Patrons froze mid-bite, startled by the sudden command. She gathered plates, cups, anything that might have touched the contaminated water, her movements swift and precise.

Back in the kitchen, Martha folded her arms skeptically. "The water? That’s impossible. The dam north of town has purifiers. Always has." She paused, the wheels turning in her mind. "Unless..." The thought hung heavy in the air, unspoken but understood. The wild magic surge—they all knew how unpredictable it had been. Achroteth, ever the pragmatist, cast a spell to purify the water they had collected, offering a temporary reprieve.

Outside, the streets were eerily quiet, as if the town itself held its breath. The group convened, their expressions grave. Fawn, resolute as ever, broke towards town hall, determination radiating from her with every step.

In the council chambers, Fawn relayed the crisis to Finroth, detailing the sick townsfolk and the parasite, her words sharp and urgent. Finroth, unflappable as always, listened with his usual measured calm. "I’ve already dispatched some of the Automatons to inspect and repair the purifiers," he said, his voice a smooth balm that somehow only fanned Fawn’s suspicions. Then, almost as an afterthought, he reached for a glass, filled it with water, and drank. "This," he said, holding the empty glass aloft, "is from a deep spring on my estate. Finest quality."

Fawn’s eyes narrowed. Her gaze flicked to the pendant around Finroth’s neck, an artifact she’d noticed before, its surface worn smooth by constant handling. She carefully asked the mayor about his prized possession.

The question struck a chord. Finroth hesitated, his carefully composed mask slipping. He traced the grooves of the pendant with a trembling hand, as if seeking solace in its texture. His voice low, almost reverent, he admitted it was a gift from his late wife Elara. For the briefest moment, the ever-composed mayor showed vulnerability, his grief as raw and palpable as the sickness spreading through the town. But as quickly as the vulnerability appeared, it was gone, replaced by the stoic visage he wore so well.

---

The north side of town was quieter than usual, the apothecary’s residence tucked among the trees like a forgotten relic. Cedrick, Dorgle, Lullaby, and Rinji arrived without fanfare. There was no need for words as Rinji stepped forward, clutching the missing journal. He handed it over to the apothecary, fulfilling the bargain struck in pursuit of the potion he desperately needed. The exchange was swift, but the weight of unspoken deals hung heavy in the air.

Dorgle lingered, his hand resting protectively over the flask of Rum Gremlin blood he carried. His usual bravado softened, replaced by something more genuine. In an unexpected display of altruism, he sold the rare blood to the apothecary, pocketing the gold but with a hidden purpose—treatment for Lullaby’s grotesque boils. The transaction came at a cost, though. Magic crackled unpredictably in the air, surging wildly as if the act itself had drawn the attention of the arcane.

On the outskirts of town, the group paused as a strange sound broke the stillness. It began faintly, like the patter of rain, but grew into the unmistakable chaos of hundreds of tiny feet. They barely had time to react before a horde of rabid squirrels descended upon them, their frenzied movements laser-focused on Dorgle. The battle was short but savage, leaving scratches and bites in its wake.

The path to the dam was eerily short, as if the world itself wished to funnel them into danger. When they arrived, the scene was grim: a small shack stood at the water’s edge, its door hanging by a single hinge, creaking mournfully in the breeze. Scattered pieces of shattered Automatons lay strewn about like the aftermath of a forgotten war. Cedrick and Rinji took the lead, stepping into the shack and immediately greeted by a wave of damp heat and air, thick and choking.

A grinding sound, sharp and mechanical, rose from beneath their feet. It grew louder, more insistent, as Cedrick located a ladder leading down into the bowels of the dam. He gestured for Rinji to follow. The narrow tunnel below amplified every noise—gears stuttering, water dripping, and the relentless thrum of something ancient and broken. Ahead, the path split, left and right, the darkness swallowing both directions. Cedrick hesitated. The silence behind them felt heavier than the danger ahead. He called for the others to join them.

When the group was together, Lullaby laid a hand on Dorgle, who had been concealing his injuries from the earlier squirrel attack. Warm light passed from the Cleric to Dorgle, knitting wounds with a quiet kindness. Before Dorgle could voice his thanks, a sound rolled through the tunnels like a distant thunderclap. A roar, guttural and alien, reverberated off the walls, chilling them to the bone.

From the shadows, the creature emerged. Its form was unmistakable—an owlbear, massive and imposing, its feathered bulk a familiar sight. But there was something _wrong_ about this one. Its eyes glowed with an unnatural light, and the twitch of its movements betrayed something deeper, something corrupted.

It inhaled sharply, the sound more mechanical than animal, preparing to unleash another roar. But the noise that came was not what sent terror coursing through their veins. It was the sight—the owlbear’s beak splitting open, unnatural and grotesque, revealing writhing tentacles that lashed hungrily toward them.
