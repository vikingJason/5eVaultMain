Royal Archivist [[Calarel Qizumin]] sends the party to investigate a town in [[Borfaldor]] that according to reports from the local Sheriff. is experiencing some troubles.

>[!note] Calarel says
How much do you all know of [[Petalwood]]?
A small village in the south of [[Borfaldor]]. great tobacco and the biggest cabbages grown in all of [[Calindor]]. A quiet village where not much happens. Until now! [[Elrohir Telrun|Sheriff Elrohir]] has been upholding law and order in that sector. but the reports over the past few months have been troubling. [[Elrohir Telrun|Sheriff Elrohir]]'s reports have been numerous and foreboding of a great threat but unclear as to what the actual cause for concern is. He has mentioned something about local Fey and their harassment of the people of [[Petalwood]]. but I doubt this is true due to the agreement struck between Queen Reeva and [[the Whispering Court]]. I don't see any reason why these local Fey in a small village would risk breaking the accord for all the Fey in [[4. World/Places/Calindor/Calindor|Calindor]]. but nonetheless we must get to the bottom of this before rumours spread like wildfire. 
What is also peculiar is his last report made it seem like everything was fine and made no mention of any problems. 
You must report to [[Elrohir Telrun|Sheriff Elrohir]] in [[Petalwood]] at once and confirm what the troubles were and that those responsible for it have been brought to justice.
Please use caution. while this may not be a threat to the Kingdom. anything that harms it's people is of great importance to the Queen. 



- There is a transportation waiting for them that will take them to [[Petalwood]]. It is a black stagecoach pulled by 4 horses. driven by a man with a leathered face and intense brown eyes and a younger woman with blond hair that is hidden under a green hood and holding a crossbow sitting next to him.

- After a few hours of travelling with the heat of the midday Summer sun blasting the walls of the carriage. it feels like these cramped quarters have turned into an oven. beads of sweat drip from your brow and you throat is so dry that even sand would provide some welcome moisture.
- But all is not so grim as you see in the distance that the sun is starting to set and with it a cool breeze starts to blow through and provide some welcome relief. 
- The peaceful silence is shattered by a cacophony of off-key music

WIS (Perception) Check
DC10 - You can hear a strange and manic laughter among the music
DC15 - As you listen out and try to determine where the music is coming from you get the sense that the source of the music seems to be constantly changing


All of a sudden a burst of smoke erupts on the road in front of the carriage. the driver pulling back on the reigns bringing it to a jolting halt.

Standing in front of you is a figure that resembles a stout human but with the furry lower bodies and cloven hooves of a goat and horns sprouting from their head. It's hard to miss that his face is haphazardly painted white with blue oversized lips and red diamonds around his eyes. and he is clad in mismatched rags and a crooked jester's hat.

>[!note] Pip says
"Halt. travelers! You have stumbled upon the illustrious Pip's impromptu performance troupe! Prepare to be amazed… or terrified… mostly terrified!"


Pip throws a handful of multicolored pebbles at the party. These explode in harmless puffs of smoke. leaving behind a faint but pleasant bubblegum scent. Initiative is rolled here.


```statblock
creature: Nilbog (MPMM)
name: Pip The Jester
```



```encounter
creatures:
  - [[Nilbog (MPMM). Pip the Jester]]
  - 4: Blink Dog
```



- [[nilbog-mpmm|Nilbog]] (A member of [[The Silent Adjudicators]])  has been steeling supplies going to the and from the Village
- Pip sits back and retreats when the [[blink-dog|blink dogs]] are dispatched


- Pip peppers the party with puns and insults. some surprisingly clever for a goblin. ("Looks like someone forgot their adventuring essentials – like. say. charisma?" or "Hey pointy-eared fella (referring to an elf). did you know a balanced breakfast is the key to a successful hero career? Because you look a little ruff!").
- The other goblins make half-hearted attacks. aiming more to trip or disarm the party than inflict serious harm.

**Mid-Combat:**

During the encounter. Pip shouts. "This performance is lacking audience participation! Time to spice things up!" He throws down a smoke bomb. creating a thick cloud that obscures the battlefield. When the smoke clears (initiative check for surprise). Pip and his goons are gone. In their place lie a few caltrops (Dex save DC 10 or take 1d4 piercing damage) and a single. very shiny object – a gold-painted nut (worth 1 sp).


**Following the Trail:**

A successful Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 12) reveals faint cart tracks leading off the highway into a nearby overgrown field. Following the tracks. the party stumbles upon a clearing dominated by a dilapidated multi-story funhouse. The funhouse stands as a decaying monument to forgotten merriment. Its faded paint boasts fantastical creatures and impossible feats. the smell of stale popcorn lingers on the air.


**The Abandoned Circus:**

A walkway almost hidden by overgrown weeds leads to the main entrance. a gaping maw of a giant. toothy grinned Jester painted on the front and a large iridescent sign reading Pip's Pleasure Playhouse of Alliteration that flickers . A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 14) reveals a hidden latch near the bottom hinge. Pushing it open reveals a narrow passage leading into the darkened interior.



**Inside the Funhouse:**

**Level 1: The Greeting Room**

![[Pips Funhouse Lv 1.jpg|htall center]]

As you enter the funhouse you are greeted by a small foyer. lit only by candles that flicker casting dancing shadows. even though there is no discernible breeze. 

You hear Pip's voice!

**Pip:** "Welcome! Welcome! It has been years since Pip's Pleasure Playhouse of Alliteration has seen a willing living soul. Do enjoy yourselves and remember the number 1 rule - no one gets out of here alive!"

A winding hallway. puppets burst out from behind corners. orbs of scrying that repeat the same meniacle laughter

**Whispers and Voices:**

- Disembodied whispers that seem to follow the party. like "They're lost... never to be found..." or "Don't trust your eyes... they lie..."
- A child's laughter that slowly turns into a chilling sob.
- A distorted voice speaking the party member's deepest fears or darkest secrets (if you know them as the DM).
- A chorus of voices chanting nonsensical rhymes or counting down from ten.

**Sounds of the Funhouse:**

- The creaking and groaning of the building as it settles.
- The sound of dripping water. growing louder as the party progresses.
- Muffled screams and shouts echoing from unseen areas.
- The rhythmic clanging of unseen chains dragging across the floor.
- The faint. scratchy sound of nails on a chalkboard.
- The sound of heavy breathing. just out of sight.
- The skittering of unseen creatures across the floor.
- The flapping of unseen wings overhead.
- The mournful howling of a distant wolf.
- A sudden. deafening silence followed by a loud crash.
- The puppet speaks in a distorted voice. mimicking the party members. either taunting them or asking for help.
- The speaker crackles to life with a distorted radio broadcast. playing a snippet of an old horror movie or emergency announcement.
- A haunting melody plays on repeat. growing louder and more discordant with each iteration.



**Level 2: The Hall of Mirrors**

This room is filled with countless mirrors. creating a disorienting maze. 

The mirrors make it shows multiple Pips standing all around you. staring and taunting. 

**Pip says:** "I see you made it this far. good! It means you are either truly brace or truly foolish! Let's see if we can figure out which one it is! Answer these Riddles 3 and I reveal that path through"



1. Who works when he plays and plays when he works? (two Answers) **a musician/an athlete**
2. What gets wetter as it dries? **one hits his missus. and the other misses his hits.**
3. What lives on it's own substance. but dies as soon as it devours itself? **a candle**


3 sections to get through the maze

* A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check (DC 12) reveals a single. cracked mirror that shows not their reflection
* Breaking a mirror causing a shatter of glass to go everywhere - DEX 12 Saving Throw or take 1d4 slashing damage
* A successful Wisdom (Survival) check (DC 12) reveals disturbances in the dust on the floor that can lead you through this section of the mirrors



**Level 3: The Topsy-Turvy Room**

You enter a room that seems to defy physics. With each step. walls become floors. ceilings become walls. and furniture clings precariously to the "wrong" surfaces.


* A successful Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DC 13) allows a character to navigate the room without falling .
* A successful Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 13) reveals the rights perspective to figure out the path through.


**Level 4: The Prop Room**


You enter a room that is a chaotic mess of dusty costumes thrown about. oversized rubber mallets covered in cobwebs and 5 ventriloquists dolls dressed up as spooky creatures sitting around the room awaiting various repairs. The air hangs heavy with the scent of mildew. 

* Zombie
* Hag
* Vampire
* Demon
* Skeleton

**Pip says:** "I see you made it this far - but this room is for performers only!"

The room goes dark and the puppets are in different positions


```encounter
creatures:
  - 5: Grining Marionette
```


```statblock
creature: Grinning Marionette (NerzugalsExtendedBestiary)
```

**Final Confrontation:**

**Level 5: The Ball Pit of Doom**

This room is filled with a desk and chair. bookshelf and a large ball pit. However. a successful Perception check (DC 14) reveals the balls are actually giant. deflated eyeballs. Stepping on one triggers a harmless (but startling) burst of air. 


Hidden amongst the eyeballs are what  appears to be stolen goods – a pouch containing a day's worth of rations for the party.

Barrels of salted meats. smoked fish. sacks of flour. Poultices made from local herbs. basic bandages. 2 x daggers. 1 x short sword. a shield and a shortbow
A pouch with 6 gp. 17 sp and 32 cp



As you approach the ball pit. Pip burst through backflipping to the other side of the pit landing on a giant ball and juggling daggers while balancing


**Pip:** "Bravo! Bravo! You made it through my little obstacle course! Now. the grand finale"



```encounter
creatures:
  - [[Nilbog (MPMM), Pip the Jester]]
  - 4:Living Shade (CCodex)
```



On his body. there is a note: 

Whispers turn to thorns. the Eladrin shall learn!



>{ .Elvish }
> ## The Hour of Shadows Draws Near
>
**To the Loyal Whispers of the Silent Adjudicators.**
>
The whispers on the Fae wind grow harsh. a chilling counterpoint to the lulling melody of the Whispering Court. They speak of complacency. of a leadership blind to the suffering of the Fae in Calindor. The Eladrin's dominance grows bolder. their arrogance choking the very land we revere.
>
**The Thorn Awaits Unfurling**
>
The Whispering Court has grown stagnant. its whispers mere echoes in the halls of power. We. the Silent Adjudicators. have seen enough. We have infiltrated their ranks. only to find them more concerned with courtly intrigue than the plight of our kind.
>
**Prepare Your Thorns**
>
Sharpen your blades. hone your whispers. and let rage burn bright within you. The time for shadows is upon us. We shall strike with the precision of a viper and the fury of a summer storm. purging the Eladrin's influence and reclaiming Calindor for the Fae.
>
**Remember Our Creed**
>- **Fae Supremacy** The Eladrin are usurpers. Calindor belongs to the Fae. and we shall claim it.
>- **The Unveiled Truth** The Whispering Court has failed us. We are the true guardians of the Fae.
>- **The Pruning of Thorns** The Eladrin blight must be eradicated. Only then can Calindor flourish under Fae dominion.
>
**Go forth. Silent Ones. Let the shadows be your cloak and the whispers your guide. The Fae dominion dawns with you. and we shall be its architects.**
>
**For the Nightshade.**
