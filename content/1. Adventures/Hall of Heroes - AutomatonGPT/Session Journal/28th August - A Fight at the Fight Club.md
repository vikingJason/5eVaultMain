## Session Overview 
 
**Stoneday, 4th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

[[Fawn]] had been successfully hiding in plain sight when she was interrupted by a Redcap requesting that she follow to join Rorrick in his office.

[[Achroteth]] finished checking on the animals in the pen, ensuring that they were all treated humanely and made his way to the fighter's lounge. He spotted Bax, who was making a confusing sight for all as he just stood staring at the the wall that he had left.

Asking for directions to Armory, he made his way to speak with the Quartermaster and investigated the armor, learning that the magic had been dispelled from the fabric of the special fighting armor.

With the knowledge in hand, [[Achroteth]] heads back to join his companions in Rorrick's office at the same time [[Fawn]] arrives.

Cautiously, [[Fawn]] shares her journal and the complaint form that [[Felgan]] had submitted for Rorrick to review. Alas, it was not enough to prove they were responsible, but Rorrick had [[Felgan]] summoned to his office, and issued orders for the other Neighbourhood Watch round up.

The party interrogated [[Felgan]], learning she hates that the club is hurting the moral fabric of [[Petalwood]]. Pressing further, they uncover that [[Felgan]] believes it isn't right that the people are lured here to drink or fight and get hurt, or almost die in the case of the poor fighter earlier.

Without a care for the Red Caps needing the blood, [[Felgan]] let slip that the Red Caps ownership of the club should end. She confesses that she could run it more efficiently and without hurting anyone revealing that she has already had conversations with Laundithus about having the Automatons fight each other rather than people.

[[Rinji]] demanded that [[Felgan]] take him to find Blaid and Layzur to get more proof that they were behind what had happened.

While being escorted, [[Felgan]] shared that ever since Queen [[Reeva]] made the agreement with [[the Whispering Court]] life in [[Petalwood]] has gotten worse. The Fae had started to integrate with the town more and more where previously they would only really interact if it was absolutely necessary and that suited everyone better.

Rorrick asked the rest of the party to wait outside while he left to announce the next fight.

[[Achroteth]] followed Rorrick to keep a protective eye on him, watching carefully as Rorrick walked out to the arena and announce that the next fight was an exhibition match between Byll and Tead, and Strider.

[[Fawn]] and [[Lullaby]] stood guard outside Rorrick's office, while [[Dorgle]] used his shadow version to access inside and lay in wait on the chance someone slips another letter under his door.

[[Rinji]] continued to escort [[Felgan]] around the Fight Club, suspicious that they had not yet found the remaining [[Neighbourhood Watch]]. They engaged in a bout of repartee before [[Rinji]] demanded that she bring him upstairs to the VIP area, contemplating to violently humiliate her.

Upstairs, the remaining Neighbourhoog Watch were nowhere to be found, infuriating [[Rinji]].

[[Achroteth]] heads out through the fighter's tunnel to watch over the next fight, spotting a frightened Byll and Teadd. His supervision of the match is interrupted slightly by Bax, curiously following a larger version of his new found best friend.

Rorrick returns to his office and it is not long before an exasperated Red Caps exclaims that all the beasts in the animal pen have gotten out.

The sounds of enraged creatures echoes through the halls causing [[Dorgle]] and [[Fawn]] to run to assist.

[[Lullaby]] stays behind to protect Rorrick's office from any intrusion.

[[Achroteth]] watches as Strider outclasses the untrained Byll and Teadd but hears animals approaching, entangling the Dire Wolves and rushing out to assist the fighters in the pit as Dire Boars and a Worg joins the melee.

Bax follows to protect his friend's brother.

The crowd is cheering as the exhibition match receives more combatants, escalating the excitement and entertainment for them.

[[Rinji]], spotting [[Felgan]]'s delight in what is transpiring can no longer contain his rage and attacks her.

[[Fawn]] and [[Dorgle]] make it to the Fighter's Lounge to see Gnarl fending off a pair Steeders, the giant arachnids ferocious in their attacks.

[[Lullaby]] hears someone trying to unlock the door to Rorrick's office and hides.

[[Achroteth]] moves closer to help Byll and Teadd, seeing them taken down not just the beasts in the ring, but by Strider as well.

He calls on his druidic powers to heal them them and provide them the opportunity to get to safety. The Strider is surprised as the beasts turn on it.

[[Rinji]] defeats [[Felgan]], satisfied that she will no longer be a menace to the group, the Fae or [[Petalwood]]

[[Dorgle]] siezes an opportunity to challenge Gnarl once the steeders are defeated and the pair square off while [[Fawn]] heads to the arena, running into the Dire Wolves still entangled.
