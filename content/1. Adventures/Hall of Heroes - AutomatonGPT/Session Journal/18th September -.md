## Session Overview 
 
**Stoneday, 4th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE**

As the group are ready to leave the Fight Club and head back to town, [[Dorgle]] spots Byll and Teadd, seizing the opportunity to interrogate the pair about spying on him while he slept. The roommates unsatisfactorily share with the intimidating dwarf that they were not involved in anything of that nature.

Not wanting to leave without the whole party, Cedric searches the underground establishment and locates [[Rinji]], still standing over the corpse of [[Felgan]] in a bloodlust daze.

The rest of the party joins Cedric just as one of the Redcap staff members happens upon the body and retrieves [[Rorick]]. The owner organises the cleanup of the corpse, but not before wiping his hat in the blood as a treat for a hard day's work.

The group heads back to [[Petalwood]] for a much-needed sleep after what feels like an eternity. Cedrick, [[Lullaby]], [[Achroteth]], and [[Dorgle]] wake up and head to the blacksmith to investigate the final reportâ€”that some fey have been stealing ore from the local blacksmith.

Walking through the busy streets, they observe some street kids irritating the local townsfolk without causing major harm.

[[The Iron Arms]] has seen better days, but the owners, [[Lerendrie Silkban]] and [[Ellywick Silkban]], appeared in good spirits. The party look around and ask some questions to gather some more information, which the owners answer without any resistance, but inconsistencies in their stories raise the suspicions of the group who press further.

Lerendrie and Ellywick confess that they had accepted money to file a false report by [[Felgan]]. They try to justify their actions by explaining that they had fallen on hard times and needed the money, in fact, they didn't even have the money to pay for the ore that was reported as stolen.

[[Achroteth]] and [[Dorgle]] left the store, while Cedric and [[Lullaby]] scold the pair. As they wait outside, one of the street kids approaches [[Achroteth]] begging for money to buy food. In an act of kindness, [[Achroteth]] produces magical berries but observes the kid throw them to the ground as he walks away.

[[Achroteth]] leads the group back to the Fight Club to pick up the pelts he was promised by [[Rorick]]. Along the way, they notice that they are being followed by a pair of shady characters trying to remain unnoticed. [[Achroteth]] transforms into a giant spider and hides among the dense canopy above. The group prepares for trouble, and get a better look at the approaching hunters but are surprised to see that they look like Byll and Teadd.

Byll and Teadd raise crossbows and combat breaks out. Cedrick realises that while these foes look like the roommates they know, there is something off about them. Cedrick's instincts turn out to be right as the stalker's bodies change and transform once they are killed. They are gaunt, humanoid creatures with slick, gray skin that looks like wet clay with elongated limbs and fingers ending in sharp claws. Their faces change too, becoming eerily faceless with large, black, almond-shaped eyes. a thin slit for a mouth and no nose or ears.
