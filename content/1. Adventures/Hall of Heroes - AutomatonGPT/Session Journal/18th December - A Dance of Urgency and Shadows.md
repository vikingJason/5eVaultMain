## Session Overview 
 
**Elday, 7th Of Emberleaf, Cycle 6880 CCE** 

Four Days Until the Unity Festival!


When Fawn wakes from her slumber she notices that an E'mail addressed to her has been slid under her door. It reads:

"My Dearest Fawn,

It fills me with so much joy to hear from you, I have been so worried.

What is Petalwood like?

What are the people like?

I hope you're eating well and getting enough sleep. Remember to brush your hair every night. And don't forget to give your day clothes a light spray with the Mist of Morning Bloom you packed. Then let them air out near sunlight, NOT in direct sunlight, I don't want those colours to fade.

Celly asked about you and if you had been in contact, but I got the sense that it was more than just following up for Calarel.

Speaking of Calarel, she has been quite forthright with everyone lately. The rumor is that she is constantly fending off verbal lashings from the Queen on the lack of updates on your diplomatic mission.

I am so proud, as I'm sure your mother will be as well, that you came up with idea to turn the Royal Dinner into a Unity Festival. A wise ruler will always find ways to achieve their goals in an efficient manner.

I will share your request for the tables and chairs with Calarel so that they can be prepared and sent immediately.

Do tell me, what have you got planned for the festival?

Is the food going to be of suitable quality?

What entertainment has been organised?

It's all very exciting?


Missing you
Ness"


Fawn set off towards the Post Office with a sense of urgency. She penned a message to Ness, Celly and Calarel, each letter with a different purpose, but all of equal importance.

Learning her lesson, Fawn haggled with the E'Mail Server, and paid the agree price to send off the letters.

A quiet panic set in as Fawn remembered that the Unity Festival was due to commence soon and there was still so much to do. She rushed to Faebric Fashions to see the Pixie trio about her new outfits. Fawn was hit with disappointment as the tailors revealed that due to the magical disturbances there were some delays with the dresses.

Fawn agreed to compromise, confirming that the first dress will be available on the morning of Galeday, and each subsequent dress would be ready in the evenings. As a token of appreciation, Tinsel offered the princess a family heirloom, the Whistle of the Whirling Wind. Fawn accepted the gift and made her way to the tavern.

Steps away from the door of the Troll's Tollbooth, Fawn heard the ringing of the Town Bell echo throughout Petalwood.

---

Cedrick got up bright and early with the sun, intent on finally uncovering the secrets of the blueprints he held in his possession. He locked himself away in his room and as if no time had passed at all he yelled out in proud excitement, he had deciphered the remaining components needed to fix his father's visor.

He already learned that he needed a shard of a Magic Magnifying Glass, he added to the list, Shadow Essence, Vision of a Soaring Predator, and the Essence of True Sight.

As Cedrick began to calculate what these components actually meant and where he might find them, the town bell rang, signalling something important and he headed downstairs.

---

Everyone gathered in the common room of the tavern before making their way to Town Hall to hear the outcome of such an important Council meeting.

As they get close they see that townsfolk have started to gather, and just off to the side a contingent of Neighbourhood Watch nervously group together and attempt small talk but their attention is elsewhere.

Fawn breaks out into a sprint towards the town hall just as Lilareth  emerges, unfurling  a scroll and addresses the crowd.

"Under Article 3, Section C, Subsection 4, the Council of Petalwood has voted and codified to appoint Mayor Finroth with Emergency Executive Powers.
The Council has agreed to the granting of these powers for a period of one week, the minimum term as per the Petalwood Charter.
Effective immediately the Neighbourhood Watch has been disbanded. And Irbaron has been stripped of his title and arrested for Crimes against the town.
Also, all Automatons owned and operated by any persons, peoples or business entities of Petalwood are hereby under the control of the Council until a referendum can be held to determine their use moving forward.
To ensure the safety and security of Petalwood, the Automatons will be used as a policing force temporarily."

Lullaby, Achroteth and Fawn discuss their current plans for the Unity Festival, looking for some suggestions, guidance and confirmation. Finroth contemplated making the festival mandatory, but Achroteth and Fawn pushed back stating that it would only leave a sour taste in everyone's mouth if they were forced to attend.

After Finroth conceded to their points, the trio head off to make further preparations for the festival.

---

Dorgle and Cedrick snuck behind the Town Hall, out of sight and ear shot. Dorgle, engrossed in his game of Wizardry, snapped a branch off a nearby tree, a perfect prop to use as his wand.

Cedrick, intrigued by Dorgle's apparent new ability to cast spells, asked to see the new book that Dorgle had acquired. Cedrick  scoured the pages of the book, looking for any clue as to how the book had granted Dorgle such powers, but he quickly realised that it was nothing more than a book.

Unconvinced, Cedrick drew on his own magic powers to try and locate where Dorgle was getting his powers from, but what he saw he did not expect. Veins of pure magic produced an aura under the very ground of where the town was built that Cedrick traced and saw that they were connected to  tree's and other living organic matter. 

The aura was flickering in such an unnatural way that Cedrick concluded that the magic forces must have been disrupted. As he tried to explain to Dorgle that it was not the book that gave him powers, but the magic crystal veins underneath Petalwood responsible for the gifts, Dorgle protested and sullenly tried to cast Fireball.

Cedrick stared in amazement as the explosion of fire filled the sky just above where they stood.

---

The explosion of fire drew the attention of Lullaby momentarily, he knew immediately that Dorgle was somehow responsible. Lullaby continued with Achroteth and Fawn to the post office.

Outside, Achroteth stood and attracted some nearby animals to deliver a message to Nimbelfick, Rorrick and the Dryad, inviting them to the Unity Festival.

Inside, Fawn drew up a lively poster, advertising open auditions for entertainers that would be held the following morning, and attract vendors to set up stalls and sell their wares. The request to have the invitation E'mailed to everyone in and around town was costly, especially because Fawn did not have each recipient's name.

With daylight hours still available, she gathered Lullaby and Achroteth and went in search of The Magnificent Constants, a Borfaldorian Puppeteer well regarded for entertaining children.

---

Cedrick and Dorgle decided to grab a refreshing drink at the tavern, but detoured when they spotted Byll and Teadd. The followed the ex-Greencloaks, careful not to alert them. The roommates spoke intently yet quietly, making it impossible for Cedrick or Dorgle to eavesdrop.

Ahead of them on the street, a tall gaunt Half-Elf with long flowing silver hair was pulling a small cart alone. Byll and Teadd immediately recognised him, yelling out in awe to Brother Varrus and rushing over excitedly. 

Cedrick and Dorgle stood back to observe, but this reservedness did not last long as Dorgle spotted the three figures he ran into earlier at the tavern, join Brother Varus.

Dorgle's look of concern was replaced with a sly grin as he confidently walked over to the group, ready as always to cause some mischief.

---

Lullaby, Fawn and Achroteth found a Satyr wearing a Top Hat and buttoned vest, entertaining children, waving his hands and concentrating on three wooden puppets as they moved around the makeshift stage and acted out a well rehearsed slapstick routine.

Fawn offered for The Magnificent Constants to audition, but his ego and forceful charm convinced Fawn to forego the audition entirely. The smug entertainer named his price, leading Fawn to question whether he was worth it or not?

But at this late stage, does Fawn have any other options?







### A Dance of Urgency and Shadows

Fawn woke to a faint rustle, her sharp senses pulling her from sleep. Sliding out of bed, she found an elegant parchment slipped beneath her door. 

The E'Mail’s contents were as warm as a hearth on a winter’s eve, brimming with affection and concern. Ness's words carried a mixture of motherly care and courtly reminders. Brush your hair, air your clothes with the Mist of Morning Bloom, and—of course—ensure the Unity Festival met the high standards expected of a royal endeavor. There was even a veiled nudge about Celly, though whether that was personal interest or political intrigue, Fawn couldn’t say.

But beneath the warmth, Fawn read urgency. Calarel was under fire from the Queen herself for the lack of updates on the diplomatic mission. Time was slipping through her fingers like morning dew evaporating under the sun.

Fawn moved swiftly. The Petalwood Post Office became her first stop. She penned three letters with precision: one to Ness, one to Celly, and one to Calarel, detailing their  progress, filled with reassurances and carefully chosen words.

Learning from past missteps, Fawn haggled with the E'Mail Server, who was glowing faintly as it calculated postage rates. Coins exchanged hands, and the messages fluttered off like enchanted birds up to the clouds.

Yet the weight of her responsibilities pressed down on her. The Unity Festival was fast approaching, and preparations were still in disarray. She made for Faebric Fashions, her usual poise faltering as she entered the boutique run by the Pixie Trio.

There, disappointment awaited. The magical disturbances plaguing Petalwood had delayed her dresses. The trio offered compromises: the first gown would be ready by Galeday morning, with others following each evening. To soften the blow, Tinsel, the eldest of the trio, presented Fawn with a Whistle of the Whirling Wind, an heirloom said to summon a protective gale.

Fawn accepted the gift with grace, though her mind churned with thoughts of what more she could do. She turned toward The Troll's Tollboth, the town bell's toll interrupted her musings, its chime reverberating through the streets.

---

Cedrick woke early, sunlight cutting through his room as he poured over the mysterious blueprints trying to deciphering their secrets, each discovery a piece of the puzzle.

Hours passed in a blur, his focus unyielding. When the final piece clicked into place, Cedrick let out a triumphant shout. The blueprint revealed not just how to repair his father’s visor, but the components needed:

- A Shard of a Magic Magnifying Glass (he already knew)
- Shadow Essence
- The Vision of a Soaring Predator
- Essence of True Sight

The clarity was exhilarating—but sobering. These components were but another puzzle to solve, their names useful but Cedrick knew that they were no ordinary items. As he began to strategize where to find them, the tolling of the town bell reached him. Something important had transpired. He tucked the blueprints away and made his way downstairs.

---

The Troll’s Tollbooth Tavern was alive with activity as the group gathered. Together, they set out for Town Hall, the bell’s chime still ringing in their ears.

The streets buzzed with murmurs as townsfolk clustered outside the hall. Off to the side, a contingent of Neighbourhood Watch stood in uneasy silence, their usual bravado replaced with nervous glances.

Fawn broke into a sprint as the doors opened, and Lilareth, a council member with a sharp gaze and a penchant for precision, stepped out. She unfurled a scroll, her voice cutting through the crowd:

“Under Article 3, Section C, Subsection 4, the Council of Petalwood has voted to appoint Mayor Finroth with Emergency Executive Powers. These powers will last one week, the minimum term permitted by the Petalwood Charter.

Effective immediately:

- The Neighborhood Watch is disbanded.
- Irbaron has been stripped of his title and arrested for crimes against the town.
- All Automatons within Petalwood are under council control. Temporarily, they will act as a policing force until a referendum determines their future use.”

The crowd’s reaction was a mixture of relief, confusion, and fear. Fawn, Lullaby, and Achroteth exchanged glances, each sensing the precarious balance the town now rested on.

Lullaby, Achroteth and Fawn headed into Townhall to converse with Mayor Finroth and finalize plans for the festival. Finroth proposed making the event mandatory—a suggestion that Achroteth and Fawn firmly opposed. They argued that force will only breed resentment, and that unity must be freely chosen, or it means nothing.

Finroth relented, agreeing to let the festival’s spirit draw people in of its own accord. With this settled, the group dispersed, each moving with purpose to ensure the festival would succeed.

---

Dorgle’s laughter echoed softly in the shadow of the Town Hall as he snapped a branch from a nearby tree, twirling it like a wand. He darted between the roots, casting imaginary spells with the glee of a child at play. Cedrick stood nearby, arms crossed, his sharp eyes fixed on the Dwarf.

Dorgle grinned, holding up his tome like a prized artifact. “It’s my grimoire! It’s how I’ve been casting spells!” He waved the stick dramatically, as though he might summon a storm at any moment.

Cedrick stepped closer, taking the book. He flipped through the pages, the parchment crackling beneath his fingers. But there was nothing—no arcane glyphs, no incantations, nothing that could explain the fire Dorgle claimed to summon. “This… this is just a book,” Cedrick muttered.

Cedrick’s brow furrowed. He extended his senses, letting his magic trace the edges of the unseen forces around them. And then, he saw it—veins of raw, flickering magic flowing beneath the earth like rivers of light. They twisted through Petalwood, connected to the trees and roots, pulsing erratically. The air hummed faintly with the unstable rhythm of disrupted energy.

“It’s not the book,” Cedrick murmured, eyes glowing faintly as he turned to Dorgle. “The magic comes from below us, from the crystal veins under Petalwood. Something is wrong with them.” He gestured to the ground. “That’s where your power’s coming from.”

Dorgle pouted. “Well, it works!” With a flourish, he waved the stick and yelled, “I cast Fireball!”

Flames roared to life, erupting into the sky in a chaotic burst of orange and gold. Cedrick staggered back, shielding his face, his mind reeling. The raw magic had answered Dorgle’s call, unstable and unpredictable. 

---

Lullaby knew without a doubt that Dorgle was responsible for the fireball. A fleeting smirk tugged at the corner of his lips, but he pressed on, following Fawn and Achroteth to the post office. The princess, ever full of ideas, had commandeered a corner of the room, sketching vibrant posters with meticulous care. 

Brushing a loose strand of hair from her face as she scrawled in bright ink, she explained that the posters will invite entertainers and vendors for the Unity Festival.

Achroteth stepped outside, summoning nearby woodland creatures to send a message to Nimbleflick, Rorrick, and the Dryad, inviting them to the upcoming festival.

---

Meanwhile, Cedrick and Dorgle, fresh from their magical revelations, spotted two familiar figures on the cobblestone streets—Byll and Teadd, former Greencloaks, deep in conversation. The pair moved swiftly, their heads low, their voices hushed. Cedrick and Dorgle exchanged a glance and began to follow, keeping their distance.

The ex-Greencloaks stopped abruptly as a tall, silver-haired Half-Elf emerged from the opposite direction, pulling a small cart. Byll and Teadd broke into wide grins, rushing to greet him with cries of “Brother Varrus!”

Cedrick held back, his eyes narrowing. Dorgle, however, couldn’t resist the pull of mischief. He spotted three more figures approaching—figures he recognized from the tavern. His sly grin returned as he strode forward, ready to stir the pot.

---

As daylight waned, the trio left the post office, their sights set on finding The Magnificent Constants, a puppeteer of renowned skill. They wandered the streets until the laughter of children guided them to a Satyr dressed in a top hat and vest, orchestrating a lively puppet show. The wooden figures danced and tumbled across a makeshift stage, the children enraptured by the Satyr’s performance.

Fawn approached him, offering an audition slot, but the Satyr, smug and brimming with confidence, raised an eyebrow. “Audition?” he scoffed. “Surely you can see my worth already.”

His price was steep, his charm forceful, and Fawn hesitated. Could they afford to lose such a talent, even at this cost? She bit her lip, the clock of preparation ticking louder in her mind.
