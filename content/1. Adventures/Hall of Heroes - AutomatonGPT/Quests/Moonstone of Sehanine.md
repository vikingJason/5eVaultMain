### **Encounter: "The Moonstone of Sehanine" (Expanded Version)**



### **Encounter: "The Moonstone of Sehanine"**

---

#### **Introduction**

The party is tasked with retrieving a **Sacred Moonstone**, a powerful artifact tied to **Sehanine Moonbow**, the Elven goddess of the moon, dreams, and journeys. The Moonstone is housed within the ruins of an ancient Feywild temple dedicated to Sehanine. It is said to amplify moonlight’s magical properties, granting visions and unlocking hidden paths through the Feywild. However, the temple is now overgrown, its wards corrupted, and its sanctity compromised by a dangerous presence.

### **Location: The Ruins of Sehanine’s Temple**

The temple lies deep in a forest glade, surrounded by luminous trees whose leaves glow silver in the moonlight. The air hums with quiet energy, and the scent of night-blooming flowers lingers. The ruins are overgrown with vines, moss, and bioluminescent fungi, but their ancient majesty remains apparent.

---

#### **Temple Layout**

##### **1. Entrance: The Moonlit Archway**

- A **vine-covered archway** marks the entrance to the ruins, flanked by glowing moon-shaped sigils that softly pulse in time with the party’s footsteps.
- Feywild flora creeps along a cobblestone pathway, with bioluminescent plants casting soft hues of blue and silver light.
- The air is filled with the faint, sweet scent of blooming moonflowers, adding an otherworldly calm. A gentle wind seems to hum a melody in honor of Sehanine.

##### 2. **The Moonlit Courtyard:**  
The entrance leads to a wide courtyard with a shallow, reflecting pool at its center.

**Statues of Sehanine**, carved from moonstone, are scattered throughout. Many are broken, their elegant forms crumbled into moss-covered rubble. Others remain intact, their serene faces gazing upward as if in prayer.

A **reflecting pool**, broken and cracked, lies at the center of the courtyard. Its waters shimmer unnaturally under the eternal twilight sky, reflecting constellations that aren’t visible in the sky above.
The water is enchanted—if disturbed, it awakens **Guardian Wisps**, small celestial entities that defend the temple.

**Challenge:**

- Stepping into the pool triggers the wisps to attack (2-4 wisps, use the _Will-o’-Wisp_ stat block).
- To safely pass, the players can offer a small prayer to Sehanine (DC 13 Religion check) or solve a riddle inscribed on the pool’s edge.

**Riddle Example:**  
_“I fade in the sun but thrive in the night;  
I guide the lost with my gentle light.  
What am I?”_  
(_Answer: The Moon_)

##### **3. Entry Room**  

##### **4. The Hall of Reflections:**  
A long, narrow hall stretches before the players, its walls polished to a mirror-like shine. The surfaces shimmer with magical illusions, showing fleeting images of loved ones, past regrets, or unrealized dreams. The hall is enchanted to test the resolve of those who enter.

**Challenge:**

- Creatures passing through must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or become charmed for 1d4 rounds, unable to move forward as they are captivated by the illusions.
- A successful **Insight (DC 14)** or **Arcana (DC 13)** check allows a character to identify the illusions as harmless and guide their companions through.
- Alternatively, one of the reflections may offer cryptic advice about the temple’s trials if the players interact with it.

##### **5. The Storage Room**  
- Careful investigation (Perception DC 15) reveals side rooms containing ancient scrolls, moonlit crystals, or Feywild relics, such as:
	- A **Starlight Diadem** (headwear that grants one use of _Guiding Bolt_ per long rest).
	- Moonlit **potions of healing**, glowing faintly and tasting of cool night air.

##### **6. Guardian’s Lair**
One room houses a **celestial wolf** blessed by Sehanine, silently watching intruders. It may attack unless the party passes a test of wisdom or reverence.

##### **7. Central Hallway**
Animated statues of elven warriors bathed in perpetual moonlight. They defend the temple by testing intruders’ worthiness.


##### **8. Path of Moonbeams**
- A shattered, once-grand hall leads deeper into the temple. The walls are adorned with faded murals of Sehanine’s blessings—depictions of elves traveling under the moonlight, visions of hidden truths, and the phases of the moon.
- Faint **beams of moonlight** cut through the cracks in the ceiling, creating shifting spotlights that seem to move when not directly observed.
- **Illusions and Magical Traps:**
    - Sections of the hallway contain illusory walls that appear solid but can be passed through (Perception DC 14 to detect).
    - False **moonstone decoys** on ornate pedestals radiate faint magical energy, triggering traps if touched. These traps might summon **Lunar Beasts** (shadow panthers or spectral hounds) or release bursts of radiant energy.


###### **Key NPC: The Moonlit Oracle**

- **Description:** An ancient elven spirit tied to Sehanine’s temple, the **Moonlit Oracle** appears as a shimmering, translucent figure bathed in soft moonlight.
- **Role:** The Oracle tests the party’s intentions, offering cryptic guidance about the challenges within the temple and the location of the Moonstone. If the party shows reverence, the Oracle may even aid them by dispelling illusions or healing minor wounds.
- **Personality:** Wise and serene, the Oracle is deeply loyal to Sehanine and speaks in poetic riddles.

1. **Activation Clue:**  
    Inscribed on the edge of the altar is a riddle written in glowing Elvish glyphs: _"Cycles flow and phases shift,  
    From shadow's fall to moonlight's gift.  
    Align the path, the truth to see,  
    A key awaits in harmony."_
    
    This clue hints that the party must interact with the phases in a specific order.
    


##### **9. Ritual Chamber: The Heart of the Temple**

The Sacred Moonstone rests on an altar Pale moonlight s, illuminating the room. 

- This chamber is littered with crumbling columns. The sanctum is dominated by an **altar bathed in moonlight** streaming through a broken section of the roof. Upon the altar you see the **Sacred Moonstone**
- A **cracked mosaic** of the moon phases spans the floor, glowing faintly. Touching the correct phase (matching the current moon cycle) could deactivate certain traps.
- Surrounding the room are **pillars etched with glyphs** in ancient Elvish, some glowing faintly. Interacting with these glyphs might:
    - Trigger protective wards (damage, blinding light).
    - Reveal hidden lore about Sehanine or the Moonstone.
- The air vibrates with a faint melodic hum, as if the temple itself sings in reverence to Sehanine’s power.

	However, the artifact is guarded by a **Lunar Shade**, a shadowy creature corrupted by dark magic and drawn to the Moonstone’s power.


###### **Combat Encounter: The Lunar Shade**

- The Lunar Shade uses the shadows of the crumbling temple columns for cover and repositions frequently with **Shadow Merge**.
- If players bring radiant light into the chamber (such as _Daylight_ or similar spells), it weakens the shade, reducing its AC by 2 and canceling **Shadow Merge**.
- The Moonstone itself pulses with latent magic during the battle, potentially offering boons to players who interact with it (see below).



###### **The Cracked Mosaic of Moon Phases**

The mosaic at the heart of the **Ritual Chamber** is an ancient and intricate depiction of the moon’s phases, radiating a quiet, mystical energy. It spans the entire floor of the chamber, and although cracked and weathered with time, its brilliance remains. The mosaic serves as both a narrative centerpiece and a functional challenge for the party.

###### **Appearance**

- The mosaic is divided into twelve sections, each representing a different **phase of the moon**, from the **new moon** to the **full moon** and back again.
- The cracks in the mosaic glow faintly, like veins of moonlight running through the floor, pulsing gently in time with the Sacred Moonstone on the altar.
- **Colors:** Each phase is subtly colored:
    - **New Moon:** Deep, shadowy blue.
    - **Waxing Crescent:** Silver streaked with lavender.
    - **Full Moon:** Bright white with golden edges.
    - **Waning Phases:** Fading into darker tones, like twilight.

###### **Puzzle Mechanics**

The party must interact with the mosaic to progress, using clues found in the temple or provided by the **Moonlit Oracle**. Each phase represents a test or aspect of Sehanine's domain, requiring the players to align their actions with her ideals.


### **Possible Interactions**

#### **1. Aligning the Phases**

The glowing cracks respond to the party’s actions. To unlock the Moonstone, the players must step on the phases of the moon in the **correct sequence**. The proper alignment mirrors the natural lunar cycle:

- **New Moon → Waxing Crescent → First Quarter → Waxing Gibbous → Full Moon → Waning Gibbous → Last Quarter → Waning Crescent.**

**Mechanics:**

- Each correct phase lights up and hums softly when stepped on.
- Stepping on an incorrect phase triggers a **trap or challenge**:
    - A radiant burst (2d6 radiant damage).
    - A summoned **Lunar Beast** (shadow panther or spectral hound).
    - A brief illusion showing visions of past Guardians’ failures.

Clues for the correct sequence may be found:
- Inscribed on the pillars in the chamber.
- In visions granted by the **Moonlit Oracle**.

#### **2. Special Phases and Their Powers**

If the party interacts with specific phases out of curiosity, unique effects occur. These could aid or hinder the group depending on how they approach the mosaic.

- **New Moon:** Shadows rise around the character stepping on this phase. The individual must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or feel an intense sense of loneliness and loss, becoming frightened for 1 round. If they succeed, they gain advantage on their next Insight check in the temple.
    
- **Full Moon:** A healing light surrounds the character, restoring 10 hit points. The light also banishes any fear or charm effects.
    
- **Waxing or Waning Phases:** These grant minor boons or banes, depending on the intent of the character:
    
    - A **Waxing Phase** inspires confidence, granting temporary hit points (5).
    - A **Waning Phase** reflects self-doubt, imposing disadvantage on the next saving throw.

---

### **Combat Integration**

During combat (e.g., with the **Lunar Shade**), the mosaic adds dynamic battlefield mechanics:

- **Moonlit Zones:** Specific phases of the mosaic emit moonlight in pulses. Characters standing on these phases gain:
    
    - **Radiant Empowerment:** Advantage on attack rolls against shadowy or undead creatures.
    - **Healing Aura:** Regain 5 hit points at the start of their turn.
- **Shadowed Zones:** Other phases are cloaked in shadow, granting:
    
    - **Cloaking Shadows:** Advantage on Stealth checks.
    - **Dark Empowerment:** Shadow-based enemies like the Lunar Shade can use these zones to heal or teleport.

These zones change every round, forcing the players and enemies to reposition strategically.




### **Expanded Narrative Opportunities**

The cracked mosaic can serve as a deeper narrative touchstone for the party:

- **Visions of the Past:** Characters who successfully align the phases may see glimpses of past events tied to Sehanine’s worship, the fall of the temple, or the corruption that summoned the Lunar Shade. These visions could provide clues for future encounters or insight into the Moonlit Oracle’s warnings.
- **A Prophetic Moment:** Lullaby or another moon-touched character might receive a vision of their future role in Sehanine’s plans. For example, they may see themselves wielding the Moonstone’s power against a coming darkness.





### **The Sacred Moonstone**

Once the Lunar Shade is defeated, the party can claim the **Sacred Moonstone**, which radiates cool, soothing energy. It appears as a large, perfectly smooth orb, faintly glowing with shifting light. Interacting with the Moonstone reveals its power and significance.

#### **Moonstone’s Magical Properties**

- **Weightless Guidance:** While holding the Moonstone, its bearer can cast _Guiding Bolt_ (spell attack +5, 4d6 radiant damage) once per long rest.
- **Lunar Visions:** The Moonstone allows its bearer to ask Sehanine for guidance. Once per week, they can cast _Commune_ (with Sehanine as the entity) without expending a spell slot.
- **Unlock Feywild Paths:** When placed under moonlight, the Moonstone reveals hidden Fey crossings, offering safe passage between the Feywild and other planes.

#### **Temple Guardians**

- **Moonlit Sentinels:**
    
    - Animated statues of elven warriors bathed in perpetual moonlight. They defend the temple by testing intruders’ worthiness.
    - They pose riddles or challenges, such as requiring the party to solve a puzzle tied to the phases of the moon or demonstrate a noble act.
- **Lunar Beasts:**
    
    - Shadowy panthers or spectral wolves prowl the ruins, drawn to the Moonstone’s lingering power. These creatures may ambush the party or serve as summoned defenders when traps are triggered.

---

#### **Environmental Hazards**

- **Illusory Terrain:**
    
    - Some sections of the temple feature illusory floors or walls, leading to hidden traps or false paths. Failing to detect these illusions could result in magical bursts (1d8 radiant damage) or temporary disorientation (causing movement halved for 1 round).


---



#### **Potential Outcomes**

- **Success:**
    
    - The party retrieves the Moonstone, stabilizing the magical rift (or fulfilling Sehanine’s guidance). The Moonlit Oracle offers a blessing: a boon to help the party on future journeys through the Feywild.
- **Failure or Complications:**
    
    - Mishandling the Moonstone or triggering excessive traps might disturb the temple’s balance, attracting **darker Feywild entities** or causing minor temporal distortions in the surrounding area.
- **Moral Dilemmas:**
    
    - If the party discovers a trapped or injured Fey creature (such as the celestial wolf or a moon-touched sprite), they may have to decide whether to aid it at the cost of time or resources.
    - The Moonlit Oracle may challenge their intentions, refusing aid if the party acts selfishly or disrespectfully toward Sehanine’s temple.

---






### **Conclusion**

The party has multiple options for resolving the quest:

- **Return to Lady Sylvara:** If they bring the Moonstone back to the Fey noble, she rewards them with Fey trinkets or gold, and her gratitude earns them her favor in future Feywild dealings.
- **Keep the Moonstone:** If the party chooses to keep it, they might incur Sylvara’s ire, but the artifact’s powers could be invaluable in their adventures.

The encounter can also serve as a springboard for further adventures:

- Perhaps the corruption that turned the Lunar Shade is tied to larger dark forces threatening the Feywild.
- The Moonstone could provide visions hinting at future quests or reveal the location of hidden treasures or threats.
