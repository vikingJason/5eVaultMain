- Drive out a group of rum gremlims who have broken into the cellar under the tavern, it is rumoured that the automatons brew very potent alcohol and the gremlins want to test how strong it really is

- drink gives different effects to creatures based on their creature type / roll for it???

* they have dug into the cellar, which leads to their hideout

* the drink gives them extra strength/dexterity (gummy bears)

* have a still/brewery equipment set up, however can't see any ingredients for making booze

* they have had to resort to stealing booze

* won't let anyone take it from them or stop them stealing



```encounter-table
name: On the way to the Den

    - 4: [[Rum Gremlin (ToB), Rum Gremlin]]
    - 1: [[Rum Lord (ToB2), Rum Lord]]

- Brew Master
-- not the first time this has happened in the past few months
-- the raw materials have recently increased inproce, causing his prices to go up
-- has the basement locked, 3 separate keys, some people aren't happy and have tried to steal, but nothing on this scale
-- if asked why he thinks it's Fae, after testing a batch, as he normally does every (4 days of the week) he saw a few smallish pot-bellied creatures, with bright green hair, orange eyes, and a drunken stare. They were only a foot tall and their mouths are filled with razor-sharp teeth.
--- not sure if the Automaton brewer (if you can even call them that) is having the same problem.
--- Automaton brewer has been making an inferior product, both in taste and potentability


- Automaton brewbot
-- their warehouse basement has constant security, a pair of security drones that patrols around the clock



- Rum Lord
-- at first sight of intruders, will try to flee
--- he will order the other Gremlins to stick around him to hold the party up
-- will try to grab a notebook from his table, with recipe in it

-- the price of alcohol has gone up, and they can not afford it any longer
-- they have tried making their own but don't know how to and even following the recipes they have has not worked, so it's either not potent enough or makes them sick
--- trying a recipe where they let wheat ferment, but haven't quite mastered it yet
-- they requested support from the Whispering Court, but have not had any luck, a company called the Silent Adjudicators did reach out though and are sending them a shipment soon so suggested the stealing as a temporary measure
-- if they can make the brew, and provide cheap materials they will stop stealing


- Althea
-- if asked about the Rum Gremlins request for support, she will advise that she has spoken to the Mayor, as part of the democratic process a relief bill has been introduced to the council however there has been much debate over certain wording and has not yet passed.
-- she has sent an email to the high council, but has not yet heard back
--- is concerned that the Silent Adjudicators have found out about this and reached out to them
--- wonders if there could be a spy within their ranks




- creatures to encounter
-- Rum Gremlins
-- Rum Lord
  
- traps/puzzle/challenge
-- lose stone, gas release
-- any fire/intense heat sets off a sprinkler system overhead
-- alchemical puzzle, 5 quart jug and 3 quart jug, need 4 quartz
-- follow instructions to create a potion/brew
  
- secrets/clues
-- could have sworn that the Sheriff had been snooping around, following them as well
--- but he was cloaked, trying to stay hidden - that isn't like him or the First Order
---- Cedric will recognise that this behaviour from a First Order member may mean that they are part of The Dawn's Sceptre
-- apparently a doppelganger infiltrated a gang/den of Rum Gremlins recently
