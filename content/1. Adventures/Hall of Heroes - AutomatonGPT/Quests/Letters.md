**To the Loyal Whispers of the Silent Adjudicators.**
>
The whispers on the Fae wind grow harsh. a chilling counterpoint to the lulling melody of the Whispering Court. They speak of complacency. of a leadership blind to the suffering of the Fae in Calindor. The Eladrins dominance grows bolder. their arrogance choking the very land we revere.
>
**The Thorn Awaits Unfurling**
>
The Whispering Court has grown stagnant. its whispers mere echoes in the halls of power. We. the Silent Adjudicators. have seen enough. We have infiltrated their ranks. only to find them more concerned with courtly intrigue than the plight of our kind.
>
**Prepare Your Thorns**
>
Sharpen your blades. hone your whispers. and let rage burn bright within you. The time for shadows is upon us. We shall strike with the precision of a viper and the fury of a summer storm. purging the Eladrins influence and reclaiming Calindor for the Fae.
>
**Remember Our Creed**
>- **Fae Supremacy** The Eladrin are usurpers. Calindor belongs to the Fae. and we shall claim it.
>- **The Unveiled Truth** The Whispering Court has failed us. We are the true guardians of the Fae.
>- **The Pruning of Thorns** The Eladrin blight must be eradicated. Only then can Calindor flourish under Fae dominion.
>
**Go forth. Silent Ones. Let the shadows be your cloak and the whispers your guide. The Fae dominion dawns with you. and we shall be its architects.**
