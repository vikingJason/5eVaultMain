			- host Royal Gala, displaying proper Royal etiquette 
			- help [[Brother Vallas]] secure a Sacred Moonstone blessed by [[Sehanine]] to perform a sacred ritual during the lunar eclipse to strengthen the connection between Calindor and the Feywilds
				- they can find the moonstone in an ancient, long-forgotten temple. Along the way, they'll face illusions, lunar-based puzzles, and spirits of the past.
				- Once the moonstone is stolen, Fawn no longer hears the voice of [[Sehanine]] in her her head.
					- It was a malevolent spirit, [[Kalistyr]], who has now been released and begins plaguing the villagers with nightmares.
					- Townspeople begin experiencing disturbing dreams, some unable to wake from their sleep, while others suffer from sleepwalking episodes.
						- [[Brother Vallas]] reveals he is a member of a Thieves Guild and needed their help to aquire the moonstone to sell to a secret buyer. He tries to manipulate [[Fawn]] by claiming that [[Sehanine]] approved of the release to teach her a lesson about the dangers of power.
					- The party must find a way to track and trap [[Kalistyr]] before more lives are ruined.
						- **Research Kalistyr**: The party must consult sages, old tomes, and maybe even the Fey themselves to learn about [[Kalistyr]]. This investigation could lead them into dangerous territory, such as old Fey ruins or confronting [[Kalistyr]]’s past victims.
						- **Identify Patterns**: [[Fawn]] must figure out the pattern of [[Kalistyr]]’s attacks. Does it target people based on their fears? Their connection to the moon? With the help of a local dream-reader, the party develops a method to predict who [[Kalistyr]] will target next.
						- **Craft a Trap**: Using the moonstone, [[Fawn]] can forge a powerful talisman to trap [[Kalistyr]]. However, the ritual to bind the spirit will require the same lunar energies that released it. The party must prepare for another dangerous ceremony during the next lunar event.

				- **Essence of True Sight**: To imbue the goggles with long-range and magical vision.
				- **Shard of a Magnifying Glass**: To restore the magical focusing ability of the lenses.
			- Cedrick must consult experts, libraries, or seek out magical merchants to identify where he can find these rare components.
				- **Shadow Essence** can only be obtained by either confronting a shadow creature or journeying to a place suffused with pure darkness. This will test his resolve and combat abilities, as shadow creatures are elusive and dangerous.
					- **Investigate Leads**: Cedrick hears rumors of an abandoned crypt where shadow creatures have been sighted. Alternatively, he could seek out a mage specializing in shadow magic who might possess the essence he needs.
					- **Confront the Shadows**: Cedrick and his companions must venture into the crypt or deal with the shadow creatures. The battle is dangerous, as shadows can drain life force and conceal themselves in the darkness.
					- **Distill the Essence**: After defeating the shadow creature or harnessing the dark energies from the crypt, Cedrick collects the **Shadow Essence**, which will later be distilled into a usable form.
				- **Vision of a Soaring Predator** a [[Stormhawk]], roams a distant mountain range. The [[Stormhawk]] is a massive predator with unparalleled sight, said to be able to spot prey miles away.
					- **Journey to the Mountain**: Cedrick and his party must travel to the mountain range where the [[Stormhawk]] resides. Along the way, they may encounter locals who tell tales of the bird’s awe-inspiring power.
					- **Lure the Stormhawk**: Cedrick must devise a way to lure the [[Stormhawk]] out of its lair. This may involve hunting its prey or climbing to its nesting grounds.
					- **Claim the Vision**: Once confronted, Cedrick faces a choice: he can try to defeat the Stormhawk in battle to claim its eyes, or use a gentler approach, such as taming or bargaining with the creature (perhaps using magic or the assistance of druids). The **Vision of a Soaring Predator** is then used to enchant the goggles.
				- **Essence of True Sight** is an exceptionally rare ingredient. Cedrick learns that it can be created from a potion brewed using Feywild ingredients or found in the hoard of a powerful wizard who once created True Sight potions.
					- **Consult with Alchemists**: Cedrick must seek out an alchemist or potion maker capable of crafting this rare elixir. The alchemist informs him that the key ingredients come from the Feywild, suggesting a journey into that realm, or a rare magical auction where such items might be sold.
					- **Feywild Adventure**: If Cedrick chooses to enter the Feywild, he must navigate its chaotic and whimsical nature to find a **Fey Crystal** that grants True Sight when distilled. This could involve solving riddles or outwitting Fey creatures who guard the crystal.
					- **Bargain for the Potion**: Alternatively, if Cedrick goes to the auction, he must bid for the potion or perhaps steal it from a rival buyer. Success grants him the **Essence of True Sight**, crucial for enhancing the goggles.
				- **The Shard of Focus** a **Shard of a Magnifying Glass**, must come from a lens crafted by a master enchanter. There’s a legendary artifact, the **Lens of Sharvas**, an enchanted magnifying glass that once belonged to a powerful diviner. The shard of this lens will provide the magical precision Cedrick needs for the goggles.
					- **Seek the Lens of Sharvas**: Cedrick and his party track down the location of the **Lens of Sharvas**, which was said to have been lost after a diviner's tower collapsed during a magical experiment. The ruins are now guarded by magical traps and constructs.
					- **Recover the Shard**: After battling through the ruins, Cedrick finds the broken remains of the **Lens of Sharvas**. Carefully removing a shard of the lens, he imbues it with the necessary magical focus needed for the goggles.
				- **Potential Rewards**
					- **Goggles of Precision**: Upon completing the repairs, Cedrick’s goggles become a powerful magical artifact that enhances his ability to see through darkness, illusions, and over great distances. The goggles also grant him heightened accuracy when casting spells or aiming ranged attacks. The goggles possess the following abilities:
						- **Pierce Darkness**: See through any form of magical or non-magical darkness.
						- **Eagle Vision**: Spot distant objects with perfect clarity, much like the vision of a bird of prey.
						- **True Sight**: See through illusions, invisibility, and hidden magical effects within a certain range.
						- **Magical Focus**: Enhance spellcasting accuracy when casting spells that require precise targeting.
					- **New Crafting Skills**: Cedrick learns advanced techniques for repairing and enchanting magical items, which he can use in future crafting endeavors. 

  
	- [[Rinji]] - figure out his destiny and keep his brother safe
		- [[Bax]]'s daughter tells him that he looks like the Guardian of the [[Shimmering Cave]], from her favourite bed time story. (including the runes)
			- It is a story about the of the "Kobold of the Fey",  a kobold with a flower beard, a Red Cap, and  Runes etched into his scales, who arises when the cave is in danger, to protect the luminous crystals and precious gems from being stolen. (the source of the Fey Magic)

			- The Guardian Must pass a series of test to prove he is worthy.
				- Trial of Strength
				- Trial of Wisdom
				- Trial of Responsibility
					- Moral Choice - protect his brother or protect the cave???
			- **Potential Rewards**
				- **Heart of Courage**: A magical boon that grants Rinji advantage on Wisdom saving throws.
				- **Guardian’s Mantle**: A cloak that marks Rinji as the true Guardian of the Shimmering Cave, providing him with defensive powers or enhancing his connection to the cave.
				- **Guardian’s Staff**: A powerful magical staff that allows Rinji to control the cave’s illusions and defenses, cementing his role as the cave’s eternal protector.


	- [[Achroteth]] - decipher Rinji's rune, confirm existence and location of [[Jewellwood Grove]]
		- learns the runes are actually a long forgotten star constellations = Stargate
			- The illustrations in Bax’s daughter’s storybook, the same one that introduced Rinji to his destiny, contain subtle clues.
				- Bax's daughter has "decorated" some of the pages in the book. Pages with illustrations on it, you can see that she has added her own special touch, drawing in herself holding hands with the Guardian, giving the villains stink lines. But on one page that shows the Guardian fighting under the night sky, she has drawn lines to connect the star clusters making her own constellations, one of the constellations  looks similar to the runes on Rinji.
			- These constellations are key to locating the Shimmering Cave.
			- The only other information is about the author, Venelien Swiftbranch, who has since sought reclusion high up in the mountains near Borfaldor.
				- was not just a storyteller, but an explorer who dedicated her life to finding the Shimmering Cave herself.
				- More clues found in her old manuscripts and personal journals.
					- By cross-referencing the first rune with his knowledge of ancient celestial lore, Achroteth discovers it corresponds to a constellation known as **"The Dragon's Eye."** This constellation is the first step toward pinpointing the cave’s location.
						- was a constellation that had held its position in the night sky for generations until one its
				- He learns that she had been on an expedition to find the Shimmering Cave herself many years ago, but never returned.
					- An ancient star chart that could provide more information. Achroteth learns that this star chart, forgotten by most scholars, lies hidden in the ruins of an ancient observatory. The observatory, once used to chart the heavens, has long since fallen into ruin and is now overgrown and forgotten.
						- **Discovering the Observatory**: After following a series of cryptic clues from the journals, Achroteth locates the long-abandoned **Celestial Observatory** hidden deep in a forest, or perhaps atop a remote mountain. The observatory is partially collapsed, but its main chamber remains intact, containing an ancient star chart etched into the walls.
							- Need the magic shard of glass in the telescope to see the first rune
								- Telescope locked in place
						- **Encountering Celestial Guardians**: As Achroteth explores the observatory, he is confronted by celestial beings or **constructs** (these are similar to the Automatons) that were left behind to guard the ancient knowledge. These creatures test Achroteth’s ability to navigate celestial puzzles and solve riddles related to the stars.
						- **Recovering the Star Chart**: After passing the tests, Achroteth recovers the ancient star chart. This chart depicts six forgotten constellations, each of which corresponds to one of the runes on Rinji’s scales. Armed with this knowledge, Achroteth is one step closer to finding the Shimmering Cave.
						- **Reward for Success**: Achroteth receives the **Starry Amulet**, a magical artifact that helps him navigate by the stars, providing advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks for navigation.
				- The star chart is incomplete and Achroteth must confirm/map the exact positions of the celestial bodies.
					- **Tracking the Second Constellation**: The second rune corresponds to **"The Winged Serpent"**, a constellation associated with celestial winds and storms. Achroteth must journey to a high-altitude shrine, where a **storm elemental** has been bound. By communing with the elemental, Achroteth can learn more about the star’s position.
					- **Investigating the Celestial Impact**: The third constellation, **"The Fallen Star,"** is linked to a celestial body that crashed to the earth many years ago. Achroteth learns of a mysterious crater, the result of a meteorite impact. Upon visiting the crash site, Achroteth finds fragments of the meteorite, which pulse with strange, otherworldly energy. Studying these fragments allows Achroteth to unlock another piece of the puzzle.
					- **Following the Celestial Path**: The fourth constellation, **"The Watchful Owl,"** is associated with a great forest where ancient Fey creatures live in harmony with the stars. Achroteth must seek out the Fey and gain their trust, allowing him to observe the stars from their sacred glades.
					- **Investigating an Astronomical Phenomenon**: The fifth rune corresponds to the constellation **"The Bearer of Light,"** which only appears during certain celestial alignments. Achroteth must time his travels to witness this rare alignment, possibly requiring him to wait in a specific location until the stars align perfectly.
					- **The Final Constellation**: The final rune is the most elusive, representing the **"Key of the Sky."** Achroteth learns that this constellation can only be observed from a place where the veil between worlds is thin, possibly requiring him to enter the Feywild or another plane of existence to view it.
				- With all six constellations mapped and deciphered, Achroteth now has the knowledge needed to find the entrance to the Shimmering Cave. However, the cave is protected by ancient magic, and only by aligning the stars in the right way can he unlock the doorway.
					- **Aligning the Stars**: Achroteth realizes that the Shimmering Cave’s entrance is hidden in plain sight but can only be opened when the six constellations are aligned perfectly in the night sky. This requires him to journey to the **Stone Circle of the Celestial Gate**, a place of ancient power where the stars can be manipulated through magic.
					- **Solving the Celestial Puzzle**: At the Celestial Gate, Achroteth must solve a complex puzzle that involves aligning celestial mirrors, positioning the stones in the correct order, and using the **Starry Amulet** to channel the light of the six constellations. This will open the way to the Shimmering Cave.
				- **Potential Rewards**
					- **Starry Amulet**: A magical amulet that helps Achroteth navigate by the stars, providing advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks for navigation.
					- **Meteorite Fragment**: A piece of the celestial body that fell from the sky, pulsing with otherworldly energy. This fragment can be used in crafting or as a key in unlocking further celestial mysteries, granting the ability to cast **Divination** or **Locate Object** once per day.
					- **Epic Boon**
				- **Potential Quest Hooks**:
					- **The Celestial Impact**: The meteorite that crashed years ago left behind strange energy in the surrounding land. Rumors speak of **mutations** or **magical anomalies** near the crater. Investigating these could lead Achroteth to hidden celestial phenomena or unique magical items tied to the stars.
						- Crystals in the shimmering cave  are tied to the Fey magic of Calindor
					- **Ancient Celestial Temples**: Scattered across the land, ancient temples or observatories once used by star-worshiping cults hold valuable clues about the constellations. Each temple may hold one of the celestial mirrors or contain powerful artifacts that can aid Achroteth on his journey.
					- **The Star-Chasing Cult**: A secretive cult that believes in the power of the fallen stars has begun tracking Achroteth’s progress. They believe that by controlling the constellations and opening the Shimmering Cave, they can unlock unimaginable power. They may offer Achroteth aid—or seek to sabotage him—depending on how their goals align.
					- **The Forgotten Seer**: An ancient seer, once an expert in celestial phenomena, is rumored to have gone mad after glimpsing the **Key of the Sky** constellation. Finding and curing the seer may provide Achroteth with valuable insights—or lead to deeper mysteries.



	- [[Dorgle]] - tap into the Dorgleverse to investigate the disappearance of the Dorgles
		- Faceless Legiong = CIA
			- the more clones that die the stronger they become
			- clone v clone: there can be only one
			- Ambushed by [[Byll & Teadd]] Changelings
				- Branded with the mark of the CIA: Clandestine Insurgency Association
				- After killing the Changelings, Dorgle feels more powerful, has advantage on all rolls for 24 hours.
			- Dorgle begins experiencing sporadic visions of other Dorgles being attacked or captured. These visions offer brief flashes of memory: an overwhelming feeling of fear and dread, the sound of metal chains, and the sight of his fellow clones being dragged away.
				- **First Location**: Dorgle travels to a known hideout where he expects to meet another Dorgle clone. When he arrives, the hideout is deserted, with signs of a struggle—broken furniture, magical scorch marks, and a shattered mirror.
					- **Skill Challenge**: **Investigation (DC 14)**: Dorgle uncovers subtle clues, including footprints leading away from the hideout, traces of a strange arcane signature, and a mark burned into the floor—the symbol of the **Faceless Legion**.
					- **Arcana (DC 16)**: By tapping into the Dorgleverse, Dorgle can sense the presence of the missing Dorgle's essence, leading him to the next clue.
					- **Encounters**: **Ambush**: On his way out of the hideout, Dorgle is ambushed by what he initially believes to be another Dorgle, but it quickly becomes apparent that this clone is a changeling from the Faceless Legion. After defeating the attacker, the changeling reveals part of the truth—there is a larger plan, and Dorgle is in danger.
				- Track down a hidden facility where the Faceless Legion is siphoning power from captured Dorgles.
					- **The Dorgle Workshop**: Dorgle traces the Legion’s operations to an abandoned Dorgle workshop where they are holding several clones in stasis chambers. The facility is filled with remnants of Dorgle technology twisted by changeling magic.
					- **Infiltration**: **Skill Challenge**: Dorgle must navigate the workshop without alerting the Legion. Stealth and cleverness are key here, as the facility is heavily guarded by clone doppelgängers.
					- **Perception/Investigation (DC 17)**: Dorgle finds records detailing how the Legion siphons magical essence from the Dorgles and their ultimate plan to use the Dorgleverse as a power source.
					- **Encounters**: **Guarded by Doppelgängers**: Dorgle will face multiple clones of himself, each with slightly modified versions of his abilities. Some doppelgängers may have the upper hand in combat, using spells or techniques that Dorgle himself has not mastered.
						- **Unique Combat Mechanic**:
							- **Clone Echoes**: The Legion can summon **echoes** of defeated Dorgles to fight against Dorgle. These spectral clones possess only fragments of the original Dorgle’s power, but enough of them can overwhelm even the strongest fighter.
							- **Puzzle**: Dorgle may encounter a series of stasis chambers that contain captured Dorgles. If he successfully frees them, he gains temporary boosts from their shared essence (e.g., enhanced strength or spellcasting).
				- Dorgle locates the heart of the Legion’s operations—an underground fortress where they’ve been conducting their experiments on the Dorgleverse.
					- **Infiltration and Investigation**: The stronghold is full of magical traps, illusions, and doppelgängers. The deeper Dorgle goes, the more he learns about the Faceless Legion’s endgame—complete domination of the Dorgleverse by absorbing all Dorgles.
					- **The Truth Revealed**: Dorgle discovers that he was specifically created by the Legion as a **conduit**. They planted him among the Dorgle clones to eventually draw all their power into one central being, which would allow the Faceless Legion to control the Dorgleverse fully.
					- **Encounters**: **Legion Leader**: Dorgle faces off against the **Leader of the Faceless Legion**, a changeling who has mastered the use of the Dorgleverse’s power. This leader can shift forms rapidly, using a combination of Dorgle’s abilities and changeling magic to create illusions, clones, and devastating attacks.
						- **Combat Mechanics**:
							- **Phase 1**: The Faceless Leader uses **clone illusions** to confuse Dorgle, summoning spectral versions of Dorgle’s own abilities against him.
							- **Phase 2**: As Dorgle weakens the leader, they begin to draw upon the full strength of the Dorgleverse, summoning echoes of all the Dorgles that have been absorbed into the Legion. The battlefield is flooded with **Dorgle echoes**, each one dealing a portion of damage but collectively posing a deadly threat.
							- **Phase 3 – The Final Choice**: In the final stage of the battle, Dorgle is given a choice: he can **sever his connection to the Dorgleverse**, ending the Legion’s ability to tap into it but sacrificing his own powers, or he can risk becoming fully absorbed by the Legion if he continues fighting without doing so.   
				- **The Aftermath Possible Outcomes**:
					- **Severing the Dorgleverse**: If Dorgle chooses to sever his connection, the Legion’s power is destroyed, and the remaining Dorgles are freed. However, Dorgle loses his magical abilities, becoming an ordinary dwarf. This might lead to introspection as he grapples with his identity in the aftermath.
					- **Victory Without Severing**: If Dorgle manages to defeat the Faceless Legion without severing his connection, he retains his powers but risks future attacks from any remaining changeling clones. The Dorgleverse remains intact but vulnerable.
					- **Defeat**: If Dorgle is defeated, the Faceless Legion succeeds in absorbing him and completing their plan, becoming the dominant power of the Dorgleverse. This leads to a dark outcome for the Dorgle clones and potentially sets up future quests where the party must defeat the new Legion overlord.

				- Lyra is a **fallen priestess of Eldath**, once a healer and protector, now twisted by dark ambitions. The priestess has forsaken Eldath’s ways and is seeking lichdom by performing a ritual that requires a rare and powerful being—**the orphan**.
				- The priestess has corrupted a once-peaceful grove, where she now gathers followers to her cause. She has formed a **cult** that believes in using Eldath’s peaceful energy to fuel their dark magic. Her ultimate goal is to sacrifice the child in a ritual that will transform her into an immortal lich.
			- The fallen priestess, now aware of Lullaby's interference, sends out her **cult champions** to capture the child. These champions are twisted versions of Eldath’s acolytes, using corrupted nature magic to hunt down Lullaby and the orphan.
			- **Combat Encounters**: Lullaby and her companions will face waves of these champions throughout the quest. The champions might include druids, rangers, and corrupted nature spirits, each wielding dark nature magic and twisted versions of Eldath’s spells.
			    - **Example Encounter**: The champions summon corrupted **treants** or **elementals** to battle Lullaby as she travels through the countryside, forcing her to confront her own powers and her connection to nature.
			    - Lullaby must protect the child from these relentless attackers, leading to a mix of combat and strategic movement as they evade or defeat the cult members.
			- As Lullaby learns more about the child, it is revealed that the orphan is no ordinary creature. The child is a **spirit of renewal**, born of Eldath’s magic, destined to cleanse the corrupted grove.
				- The fallen priestess intends to use the child’s inherent magic to complete her transformation into a lich, but Lullaby’s task is to keep the child safe and ensure that the spirit’s powers are used for good.
				- **Skill Challenge**: Lullaby must use her skills (nature, insight, and survival) to teach the child about the world and help them unlock their potential, nurturing their growth and guiding them away from dark paths.
			- Lullaby must uncover the priestess’s history and find out what led her to fall from grace. This requires investigating old temples of Eldath, talking to former acolytes, and uncovering lost lore. Along the way, Lullaby may discover:
				- The priestess was once a revered healer and defender of nature, but she lost her faith after a traumatic event.
				- The **holy waters of Eldath** that once nourished her grove have been tainted, corrupting the area and the priestess herself.
				- The only way to stop the priestess may be to purify the waters of the grove, restoring the balance between Eldath’s peaceful energy and the natural world.

						- It is very similar to Lich ritual.
			- **Final Confrontation: The Corrupted Grove**

				- **The Fallen Priestess**: The priestess is in the final stages of her transformation into a lich. To stop her, Lullaby must purify the grove while defending the child.
				- **Boss Fight**: The priestess, corrupted and powerful, will use necromantic spells and corrupted nature magic against Lullaby. She will summon dark creatures from the grove to aid her, such as shadow wolves, skeletal treants, or corrupted dryads.
				    - As the battle rages on, the priestess becomes more desperate, attempting to complete her lich transformation. Lullaby must interrupt the ritual by destroying key items or by using the purified waters of Eldath.
			- **Quest Challenges**:
				- **Moral Dilemma**: At various points, Lullaby may face moral decisions about how to handle the child’s future, whether to trust local authorities, or how to deal with the priestess. The priestess may attempt to manipulate Lullaby, claiming that her transformation is necessary to bring balance.
				- **Cult Interference**: The fallen priestess’s cult will attempt to sabotage Lullaby at every turn. They may infiltrate the town, bribe officials, or stage attacks on her allies to slow her progress.
				- **Protecting the Child**: Lullaby’s central challenge will be keeping the child safe from harm while also teaching them about the world. The child’s powers will grow over time, but they may also attract attention from dark forces.
			- **Potential Rewards**
				-
