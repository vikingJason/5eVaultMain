How crystal magic is tied to calindor
What do Quicklings want for dead gems


Holy Water blessed by the  power of the Night of the Silent Choir.

- if they ask anyone in town about this, they tell them what the Night of the Silent Choir is, suggest that perhaps Brother Vallus might be able to help them understand how someone might use the power of the lunar phase to make Holy Water.
- a kook that lives alone in a long abandoned shrine in the woods, he comes to town every four weeks to pick up supplies, is due any day now.
- Brother Vallas (imposter) agrees to bless the Holy Water for them. Asks Fawn to secure the Sacred Moonstone.







According to legend passed down through the generations of Quicklings, it is said that many millennia ago, a comet of pure starlight collided with Calindor. This cosmic event was so intense that the force of the impact created so much pressure that it fused stone into crystals imbued with its celestial magic. The same magic that flows through the veins of all Fey, blessing us with our gifts.

These crystals flow in intricate veins beneath the surface, like a complex web, linking the realms with a flow of raw, magical energy. 

This magic is bound to the delicate balance of Calindor’s nature because it weaves together elements, physics, and even the essence of magic itself. Tampering with these crystals can alter the very reality of Calindor. As you've just witnessed time was easily disrupted within the room by just a small splinter.

This is a much guarded secret though, for fear that someone may try to manipulate the crystal for destructive purposes.

When the Eladrin first arrived in Calindor, they heeded the warning from the indigenous fey. They signed a contract to only disclose the power of these crystals to the ruler of the realm and defend Calindor from those that seek to use the power for evil.

And defend Calindor they did, valiantly and many times.

Grommok Bloodrager.
Aurzath.
From Tyr, when he used your uncle, Thunderhead, to gain control from within.

There is of course the rumor that the plague that recently ravaged the Eladrin, was caused by a group of Fey bent on eliminating all non-Fey in Calindor.

So please, your highness, keep this secret guarded.







# Shard of the Eternal Vein
*Melee Weapon, Rare (requires attunement by a creature proficient with spears)*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 piercing 
- **Properties**: Requires Attunement,  Thrown (Range 20/60), Versatile (1d8), +1 to attack rolls
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

## Description

**Time Piercing** The weapon is unnaturally sharp, granting a +1 to the melee sttack and damage rolls.

**Magical Flicker** : The spear starts with 3 charges when fully charged, replenishable only by exposure to powerful celestial energy. When all charges are depleted, all bonus and magical properties of the spear are nullified.

**Temporal Guide:** **(Charge Ability)** As a reaction, the weilder can expend 1 charge to bend time to aid in the heat of battle. This temporary time disruption is used to turn a missed attack into a hit, or turn a hit into a critical hit for a creature it can see within 30 feet.

**Phase Shift:** **(Charge Ability)** On a successful attack with the spear, the weilder can expend 1 charge to create a temporal distortion field around the target. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or phase partially out of reality, becoming Incorporeal until the end of its next turn. While phased, the target cannot interact with the physical world, is immune to physical damage, and cannot affect or be affected by other creatures. However, it also can’t take actions on its next turn.

**Fragile Reality:** After each charge is expended, or the attack roll is +5 below the target AC, the wielder rolls a d20 to determine if a fracture forms within the crystal. The DC starts at 1 and increases by 1 after each critical hit. Failure indicates a fracture and the magical essence within the spear leaks, depleting the any remaining charges. If the spear is fractured 3 times without being repaired, it shatters and can not be repaired.


1 charge to induce a disruptive temporal effect on a target within reach:

Effect Options (Choose One):



**Time Lock:** **(Charge Ability)** When the spear is thrown more than 5 feet at a target, the weilder can expend a charge to reduce the target’s movement speed is reduced to zero until the end of its next turn.

If charges are depleted, see the "Depletion Consequences" section below.



2. Essence of Reality

The crystal emits a faint, prismatic glow in dim lighting. This can illuminate a 10-foot radius around it, casting light reminiscent of the shimmering crystal within the Quicklings cave.

The wielder occasionally hears whispers from the crystal, fragments of unknown voices speaking of guardianship, destiny, and the unbreakable connections of time.


Whispers of Destiny: The wielder occasionally hears voices speaking of their fate as a Guardian, fragmented words about the Shimmering Cave and the crystal network that ties their world together.




3. Recharge Potential

To fully recharge its depleted essence, the spear must be exposed to a powerful source of magic, such as a large magic crystal or cluster of crystals, water blessed by the moonlight during the Night of the Silent Choir (the lunar phase where both of Calindors moon are full), or proximity to a legendary entity.

When recharged, the crystal may allow the wielder to temporarily access an additional ability, like glimpsing a few seconds into the future (advantage on a single saving throw or skill check).

Drawbacks and Quirks

1. Fractured Temporal State

As a partially depleted crystal weapon, the spear may have unpredictable effects when pushed to its limits. On a critical hit, roll a d6:

1-2: The spear behaves normally.

3-4: Temporal Echo – The target sees brief duplicates of itself, leaving it disoriented. The target makes a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or has disadvantage on its next attack.

5-6: Flicker of Instability – The spear creates a short delay in reality, dealing additional psychic damage equal to 1d6 but inflicting 1 psychic damage to the wielder as well.

Potential Evolution Stages

Over time, as the character embraces their destiny as the Guardian of the Shimmering Cave, the spear can evolve through major milestones:

Stage 2: The Crystal Guardian’s Embrace

Unlocks “Temporal Paradox” ability, allowing the wielder to delay an enemy's next action once per day.

The spear glows more vibrantly, and the wielder gains resistance to psychic damage while holding it.


Stage 3: The Heart of the Crystal Vein

Grants the wielder the ability to shift their position in time by a single round, effectively letting them "undo" an action they've taken once per week.

The crystal gains hardness, becoming immune to minor fractures and able to “heal” itself when exposed to the heart of the Shimmering Cave.
