After touching what was initially believed to be a mundane painting of a game board, the party soon found themselves pulled into a nightmare-scene. An abandoned camp set up inside some dungeon, a tragic story with no one to tell it, a defaced statue and messy graffiti, the party must figure out what occurred in this place

Regardless of whatever happened to the previous occupants, the rules of the game remain the same and are as follows:

- Only one player may enter at a time. The grid is a simple 12x12 square platform. Each square is slightly larger than 5ft (So the players can see the direction of the arrows under their token)

- The game begins when a player steps onto the golden sun.

- The player must follow along the arrows and navigate to the other golden sun to win.

- When the game begins, a ghost spawns at one of the skulls and chases the player . For every tile the player moves, the ghost moves one, also following the arrows.

- If the ghost catches the player, they are kicked out of the game and take an appropriate amount of damage for their level. (As a guide,1d10 per character level should be good)

- If players touch the skulls, the game immediately fails.

- The middle four squares are a safe-zone. Ghosts cannot enter this zone, but are free to move outside waiting for the player to leave.

-If touching a blue hexagon, the player must roll a d144 and immediately go to that position on the board. The ghost also rolls a d144 and change position accordingly, though they are unable to trigger this by walking over blue hexagons themselves.

-If touching a chest, an additional ghost spawns at one of the skulls (DM's choice on whether its the closer or further skull). Should they complete the puzzle, reward them with something nice for their efforts

Depending on how fast the player completes this, you may choose to have this puzzle's magic nullified upon completion, or require each player to complete the puzzle to progress
