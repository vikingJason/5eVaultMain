-- if asked why she thinks it's the Fae, she says that there have been some signs that all point to Fey/Fey magic.
--- faint shadows and light-absorbed areas, near the smithy shop, so obviously she was being surveiled
--- glowing, ephemeral trails and slippery, oily residue have been found on the delivery routes

The blacksmith will approach the party in the tavern and apologise for lying, explaining that they weren't actually paid by the Green cloaks to blame the Fey. They did it to buy themselves some time to investigate a rare mineral deposit, showing the party a rare ore found near a large oak tree deep in the forest.

The tree is home to a Quickling den.
The blacksmith wants help to strike up an agreement with the Quicklings for the rights to mine in exchange for a healthy share of the profits.
They also need help obtaining the proper permits from the town council.

This sets the town into a frenzy as many villagers have fallen on hard times so a group of them who are looking to own the mining operation try to violently drive out the quicklings so they don't have to be paid




### **The Blacksmith’s Approach**

In the tavern, the blacksmith sheepishly approaches the party, apologizing for the false report about the Fey. He explains his desperation and why he lied, revealing the true reason: he discovered a **rare mineral deposit** near an ancient oak tree deep in the forest and needed time to assess its value without drawing attention. However, the tree is home to a **Quickling den**. He shows the party a piece of the ore and explains its potential value, suggesting a partnership:

- The Quicklings have been there for generations, and while they’re mischievous, they’re not inherently hostile. The blacksmith believes that a **fair agreement** can be reached if the party helps negotiate.
- The blacksmith wants to work with the Quicklings in exchange for a **fair share of the profits**, offering the Fey wealth and goods in return for access to mine under the tree.

### **Town Frenzy**

However, rumors about the ore have spread, and it’s not long before the **town falls into a frenzy**. Many villagers have fallen on hard times, and the idea of **striking it rich** has led a group of them, fueled by greed and desperation, to see the Quicklings as an obstacle to their prosperity. A dangerous mob begins to form:

- **Local Opportunists**: Some wealthy or influential townsfolk, along with opportunistic merchants, try to **seize control of the situation**. They start organizing efforts to drive the Quicklings out, hoping to **cut them out of any deal**. The villagers see the Fey as an easy target, thanks to years of anti-Fey sentiment, and some opportunists might even spread propaganda to paint the Quicklings as dangerous and inhuman.
- **The Mob’s Plan**: The mob plans to **violently expel the Quicklings** from their home, ensuring that no agreement needs to be made and that the townsfolk can claim the ore for themselves. Some townsfolk might plan to kill the Quicklings, while others just want to scare them off, unaware of the chaos this could unleash.

### **The Party’s Role**

The party is now caught in a tense situation with multiple possible courses of action. Their choices could drastically affect the outcome:

1. **Negotiation with the Quicklings**
    
    - The party can accompany the blacksmith to **negotiate directly with the Quicklings**, who are understandably suspicious of outsiders. The Quicklings might be open to a deal, but they could demand a high price—perhaps magical goods, protection from poachers, or influence in town decisions.
    - The party might need to **prove their goodwill** to the Quicklings by completing a quest, such as driving off a group of poachers, helping them with a rival Fey faction, or retrieving a magical item from the forest.
2. **Dealing with the Town Mob**
    
    - The party might decide to **stop the mob**, either through diplomacy or combat. The mob could be led by charismatic or manipulative figures who stoke the fires of greed and fear, but some villagers are just desperate, and the party could defuse the situation by offering **alternatives to violence**.
    - Alternatively, the party could **side with the Quicklings** to protect them from the mob, helping fortify the den or preparing traps and ambushes for the villagers. This could lead to a tense standoff, where the party must prevent bloodshed on either side.
3. **Involvement in the Town Council**
    
    - The blacksmith needs **permits from the town council** to make the mining operation legitimate, so the party could get involved in local politics. They might need to **convince key members** of the council to approve the deal, especially if there’s opposition from anti-Fey factions.
    - The council could be **split** on the issue, with some seeing the potential wealth as a boon for the struggling town, while others are concerned about the ethics of displacing the Fey or the environmental impact of mining. The party may have to sway key council members by performing favors or gathering information to blackmail or persuade them.
4. **Hidden Agendas and Consequences**
    
    - **Greedy Influencers**: Some wealthier townsfolk may be backing the mob in secret, hoping to secure the mining rights for themselves. The party could uncover a conspiracy where these powerful figures are planning to **monopolize** the mining operation after driving off both the Quicklings and any independent miners like the blacksmith.
    - **Town Prosperity vs. Exploitation**: The mining of the rare ore could bring **prosperity** to the town, but at what cost? The party might have to balance the potential wealth and benefits to the struggling townsfolk against the ethics of mining in a sacred Fey location. Additionally, reckless mining could lead to **environmental consequences**—the tree might have magical significance, and disturbing the ore could weaken local magic or cause long-term damage to the land.

### **Potential Complications**

To keep the tension high, you can introduce the following twists or complications:

1. **The Ore’s Magical Properties**  
    The rare mineral is **not just valuable** for its material worth—it has strange, magical properties that could make it highly sought after by powerful mages, merchants, or even criminal organizations. If the party isn’t careful, they could attract the attention of dangerous outside forces looking to control the ore.
    
    - Mining the ore might also have **side effects**. It could disrupt local magic, causing strange phenomena like sudden weather changes, Fey creatures acting erratically, or even the appearance of ancient magical guardians tied to the land.
2. **Quickling Defense Mechanisms** The Quicklings are not defenseless. If the mob attempts to drive them out, they might use **illusion magic, traps, and guerrilla tactics** to defend their home. The party could be caught in the middle of a chaotic battle, trying to prevent both sides from escalating the conflict.
    
    - If negotiations fail, the Quicklings could call upon **other Fey creatures** to protect the tree, leading to an all-out Fey-villager conflict.
3. **Town Unrest** The frenzy over the ore causes **division within the town**. Some villagers might side with the Quicklings, seeing the greed of their neighbors as dishonorable, while others see the potential wealth as a solution to their economic problems. The party might have to navigate a **growing conflict** within the town itself, as different factions argue over what to do.
    
    - The town guard might be **split** on how to handle the mob, leaving the party to decide whether to try and **protect the Quicklings** with limited resources or convince the guard to intervene.
4. **The Faction's Return** The **Anti-Fey faction** that the party previously encountered might use the situation to **stoke hatred against the Fey**, attempting to seize control of the town’s decisions and blame the Quicklings for the unrest. They could even manipulate the mob into escalating the violence.

## Cracking the Code

The players are greeted by three sets of nine numbers, each arranged in a square. A few of the numbers are colored green... what exactly is going on here?

**Difficulty:** Apprentice

**Time:** 30 minutes

### Set Up

When you show your players this puzzle (the image named "numbers" this puzzle's materials), describe it as numbers written on a surface (they are not buttons and are not meant to be pushed or interacted with by the players - just viewed).

Additionally, when describing the green numbers, describe it as a paint of some kind. You may also want to mention that there are remnants of green paint on the other two groups of numbers, but that it had been washed away, making it impossible to tell which of those numbers were originally painted green. This is to indicate to the players that, for each of the three sets of numbers, some of the numbers are meant to be green.

### Solution

To solve this puzzle, the players must realize that, for each of the three groups of numbers, some numbers either obey a certain rule or disobey that rule. For the middle group, the numbers which obey that rule are shown in green, but the players will have to figure out which of the numbers from the other two groups obey the rule.

To understand the rule, the players must first realize that each of the ten digits can be written by filling in a specific combination of squares on a 3 by 3 grid. For example, the squares corresponding to the number "4" are exactly the squares shown in green in the middle group of numbers.

To obey the rule, a given number must be in one of the positions on the 3 by 3 grid that would be filled if you were to write that number as described before. For example, if you were to draw the number 0 on a 3 by 3 grid, you would fill in every square except for the center square; therefore, the only 0s that don't obey the rule (aren't meant to be green) are 0s in the center of a 3 by 3 grid.

Following this logic for the other two groups, the players will find that the "green" numbers in the left group are all of the numbers in the top row and all of the numbers in the right column - and that the "green" numbers in the right group are all of the numbers except for the left-most 7.

Once all of the "green" numbers have been identified, the players will notice that the set of green numbers on each 3 by 3 grid are arranged in a way that make them "write out" (as described before) three specific numbers: 7, 4, and 3.

Once the players have locked in "743" as their code, they will solve this puzzle!

### Hints

_(Give in order)_

**Hint #1:** "There are three groups of numbers, and you need a three-digit number to solve the puzzle... perhaps each group can give you a number?"

**Hint #2:** "The green numbers are arranged in the shape of a 4 - perhaps 4 is the middle digit in the code..."

**Hint #3:** "A number's value and position on the 3 by 3 grid contribute to whether or not it is meant to be green."

**Hint #4:** "Just like the green number 4, imagine drawing other numbers on that 3 by 3 grid..."

**Hint #5:** "For each number, there are some positions on the 3 by 3 grid that would make them green. For the number 8, it is every space."

### **Final Outcome**

The resolution of this situation can have long-lasting consequences for the town and the Fey:

- If the party successfully **negotiates a peaceful agreement** between the Quicklings and the town, the mining operation could bring **shared prosperity**, with both sides benefiting from the newfound wealth. This could also strengthen relations between the Fey and the town, leading to future cooperation.
    
- If the party fails to stop the mob, the Quicklings might be driven out or slaughtered, which could lead to **Fey retaliation** or the **cursing of the land**. Mining the ore without Fey cooperation might result in disaster, as the magic tied to the oak tree could be unleashed in unpredictable ways.
    
- The party could also choose to **take control** of the mining operation themselves, cutting deals with either the blacksmith or other town members, which might earn them wealth but also make them enemies within the town.
    

This setup creates a highly engaging scenario where the party must balance diplomacy, action, and political maneuvering, while the town’s greed and desperation threaten to plunge both the human and Fey populations into conflict.
