- Blacksmith
-- did not report that ore was being stolen, reported that shortly after ore was delivered, she would make shovels and tools, etc and that those were being stolen. Generally during delivery
-- if asked why she thinks it's the Fae, she says that there have been some signs that all point to Fey/Fey magic.
--- faint shadows and light-absorbed areas, near the smithy shop, so obviously she was being surveiled
--- glowing, ephemeral trails and slippery, oily residue have been found on the delivery routes


- staking out the blacksmith 


-- A group of villagers have formed a group of bandits that steal these tools, have them blessed and sell them to people at a discounted price.
-- they pay different fey creatures to steal them and deliver them to an abandoned shack in the woods

- secrets/clues
-- the Fey were hired by a group of bandits so that they can sell the items to people at a discounted price
--- the bandits are actually villagers who are looking to make some quick money
-- they were meant to be stealing from the Automaton blacksmith
--- the Fey decided to steal from the dwarf blacksmith because the automatons had better security
--- also, The Silent Adjudicators have made it clear that the Automatons are creations of people and so it is the Eladrin that are the true cancer of Calindor
