- Underground Fighting Ring/ Investigation: Rumors circulate about an illegal underground fighting ring run by a group of Red Cap.  
  
Head to the village person who raised the report.  
-- she is a well merchant's wife and member of the neighbourhood watch  
-- she followed a farmer through the forrest when she suspected they were doing something illegal to obtain money. She lost track of them, they must have raced ahead on the road and taken a hidden path or something  
--- this suspicion was due to the farmer being able to afford fertiliser, surely they couldn't be able to afford it  
-- she also overheard them in the tavern later that evening with fresh bruises, talking about the club, and mentioned something about the Apothecary.  
--- if asked about why she thinks it Red Caps running it, she says that was sure that she did see some Red Caps in the village purchasing some supplies  
---- the neighbourhood watch commander has told them all that Red Caps are known to be drawn to places where blood is often spilled  
  
Neighbourhood watch commander  
- her actions have not been sanctioned  
- doesn't preach hate, but rather spreads known information about creatures and people that can used to set up better safety precautions for Petalwood  
  
  
Elf farmer  
- has no visible bruises or injuries  
-- insight/medicine/perception check reveals that he is favouring his left arm, he has a slight bruised eye, but it is covered up with makeup/healed quite quickly  
--- Apothecary provided him with some cheap herbs that healed his bruises, but have caused his some abdominal discomfort  
--- if asked about how he got the injuries, say that his pet accidentally knocked the ladder out from under him while he was repairing the roof of his barn  
- does not confirm that there is a fightclub  
-- if pressed about the money, successful Persuasion, Intimidation check reveals that his wife is pregnant so has been doing a few side jobs to get some cash  
-- if pressed, reveals that he has been building a drainage system under a building, but its odd because it doesn't drain into any sort of waterway, but rather into a pool.  
-- is tight-lipped about the location of the person's who hired him to do the job, but will agree to tell them if the team can help him with a small favour, his wife really wants a sweet treat from the town baker, asks if he can impose and ask them to buy him one if it's not too much trouble because he can not afford it.  
  
  
  
When they get to thr location,  
Using the service location they find the drainage system and the covered tank/pool (filled with blood)  
  
Going through the front door, they are met by some guards, one of them always has his finger to his ear (it's just always itchy, but learned that people think it's rather intimidating)  
  
There is a check in, pay to enter, check coats and/or weapons.  
- given a form with the rules and betting process  
  
The double doors open revealing a large arena, an upstairs viewing platform all around it.  
Lower level has people going all kinds of crazy. Upstairs it's a lot more calm with fancy people.  
Currently a fight going on between 2 creatures - monstrosities/people???  
  
Studying the arena reveals that the floor is actually a large grate.  
  
A Red Cap enters the centre of the arena to make an announcement.  
Talks about rules.  
Next match and encourages them to bet.  
  
If they wish to participate in a fight, as an undercard fight the rewards are low but they can pick an opponent from the list.  
Different opponents have different rewards depending on their standings.  
Need to win 1 fight per "class" to move up to the big ticket fights.  
First 3 classes = all fighters must wear a special armour that acts as a damage limiter, will not let a fighter get to 0hp, it will light up bright blue and flash when this occurs  
Unclassed = no rules  
  
Class 1 - 50cp:  
- Bakaris Uthe Estide  
- Cultist  
- Stryx  
  
Class 2 - 50sp:  
- male steeder

- all fights are 1v1, unless an exhibition match (which pay extra to the winner, can organised at request)  
- no outside help (wards to prevent magic being cast outside the arena to affect inside arena - with arcana check can find how to disable them)  
- no tampering with any of the armour (at the 3rd fight, someone will disable this function on the armour)  
  
They can bet on their fights as well.  
  
  
  
* crowd  
-- can fight to gain support of the crowd  
-- will talk about that the money they won/lost betting  
--- can tell who they bet on and the outcome  
  
* Red Cap manager 
- is proud of what they do  
- everyone who participates volunteers  
- monstrosities are all kept down stairs and treated really well, like the red caps, they are all just misunderstood creatures often feared and treated poorly  
- if asked about the grate, offers that it is just a way to make things easy to clean and maintain throughout the evening (lie)  
- if asked about the pool, offers that it is because the waste needs to be disposed of correctly otherwise it is just polluting the forrest (lie)  
-- if pressed, reveals it is so they can all wash their caps and sustain themselves.  
-- the Peace Accord has made it difficult for them because they can't just attack people for fear of breaking the peace.  
-- the arrangement they had with the farmer/butchers in town to collect the blood of the animals they butcher has not been as abundant as it once was, for the past few months  
--- is not happy with the accord/Whispering Court  
  
  
* as they talk to people, someone realises that a spectator is actually there as a spy to gather information and dob them into the authorities  
- Red Caps want to deal with them harshly  
  
  
- traps/puzzle/challenge  
-- magic wards  
-- damage limiting armour, tangled with (either to turn on for the head line fight, or turned off for the 3rd fight)  
  
- secrets/clues  
-- the red caps need to wash their caps in the blood from the fights to stay alive  
-- used to have an agreement with the farmers for the blood of their livestock when butchered, they don't have as much to sell now  
-- they refuse to make the same deal with the Automatons and see them as unnatural  
-- people who fight do so to afford blackmarket supplies, e.g. seed, fertiliser etc  
  
- loot  
-- leather armour that will prevent the wearer from dropping to 0hp, this requires a blood soaked Red Cap hat wiped over a magical rune on the armour to recharge this property. Requires a d20 roll, starting at DC 1. Every subsequent succes increases the DC by 1.
