- Underground Fighting Ring/ Investigation: Rumors circulate about an illegal underground fighting ring run by a group of Red Cap.  
  
Head to the village person who raised the report.  
-- she is a well merchant's wife and member of the [[neighbourhood watch]]  
-- she followed a farmer through the forrest when she suspected they were doing something illegal to obtain money. She lost track of them, they must have raced ahead on the road and taken a hidden path or something  
--- this suspicion was due to the farmer being able to afford fertiliser, surely they couldn't be able to afford it  
-- she also overheard them in the tavern later that evening with fresh bruises, talking about the club, and mentioned something about the Apothecary.  
--- if asked about why she thinks it Red Caps running it, she says that was sure that she did see some Red Caps in the village purchasing some supplies  
---- the [[neighbourhood watch]] commander has told them all that Red Caps are known to be drawn to places where blood is often spilled  
  
[[Neighbourhood watch]] commander  
- her actions have not been sanctioned  
- doesn't preach hate, but rather spreads known information about creatures and people that can used to set up better safety precautions for [[Petalwood]]  
  
  
Elf farmer  
- has no visible bruises or injuries  
-- insight/medicine/perception check reveals that he is favouring his left arm, he has a slight bruised eye, but it is covered up with makeup/healed quite quickly  
--- Apothecary provided him with some cheap herbs that healed his bruises, but have caused his some abdominal discomfort  
--- if asked about how he got the injuries, say that his pet accidentally knocked the ladder out from under him while he was repairing the roof of his barn  
- does not confirm that there is a fightclub  
-- if pressed about the money, successful Persuasion, Intimidation check reveals that his wife is pregnant so has been doing a few side jobs to get some cash  
-- if pressed, reveals that he has been building a drainage system under a building, but its odd because it doesn't drain into any sort of waterway, but rather into a pool.  
-- is tight-lipped about the location of the person's who hired him to do the job, but will agree to tell them if the team can help him with a small favour, his wife really wants a sweet treat from the town baker, asks if he can impose and ask them to buy him one if it's not too much trouble because he can not afford it.  
  
  
  
When they get to thr location,  
Using the service location they find the drainage system and the covered tank/pool (filled with blood)  
  
Going through the front door, they are met by some guards, one of them always has his finger to his ear (it's just always itchy, but learned that people think it's rather intimidating)  
  
There is a check in, pay to enter, check coats and/or weapons.  
- given a form with the rules and betting process  
  
The double doors open revealing a large arena, an upstairs viewing platform all around it.  
Lower level has people going all kinds of crazy. Upstairs it's a lot more calm with fancy people.  
Currently a fight going on between 2 creatures - monstrosities/people???  
  
Studying the arena reveals that the floor is actually a large grate.  
  
A Red Cap enters the centre of the arena to make an announcement.  
Talks about rules.  
Next match and encourages them to bet.  
  
If they wish to participate in a fight, as an undercard fight the rewards are low but they can pick an opponent from the list.  
Different opponents have different rewards depending on their standings.  
Need to win 1 fight per "class" to move up to the big ticket fights.  
First 3 classes = all fighters must wear a special armour that acts as a damage limiter, will not let a fighter get to 0hp, it will light up bright blue and flash when this occurs  
Unclassed = no rules  
  
Class 1 - 50cp:  
- Bakaris Uthe Estide  
- Cultist  
- Stryx  
  
Class 2 - 50sp:  
- male steeder  
- Sarith Kzekarit  
- Lords Alliance Guard  
  
Class 2 - 50gp:  
- worg  
- Ront  
- Faroul  
  
200gp Unclassed  
(Current Champion is their prized Gnoll Flesh Gnawer)  
  
- all fights are 1v1, unless an exhibition match (which pay extra to the winner, can organised at request)  
- no outside help (wards to prevent magic being cast outside the arena to affect inside arena - with arcana check can find how to disable them)  
- no tampering with any of the armour (at the 3rd fight, someone will disable this function on the armour)  
  
They can bet on their fights as well.  
  
  
  
* crowd  
-- can fight to gain support of the crowd  
-- will talk about that the money they won/lost betting  
--- can tell who they bet on and the outcome  
  
* Red Cap manager 
- is proud of what they do  
- everyone who participates volunteers  
- monstrosities are all kept down stairs and treated really well, like the red caps, they are all just misunderstood creatures often feared and treated poorly  
- if asked about the grate, offers that it is just a way to make things easy to clean and maintain throughout the evening (lie)  
- if asked about the pool, offers that it is because the waste needs to be disposed of correctly otherwise it is just polluting the forrest (lie)  
-- if pressed, reveals it is so they can all wash their caps and sustain themselves.  
-- the Peace Accord has made it difficult for them because they can't just attack people for fear of breaking the peace.  
-- the arrangement they had with the farmer/butchers in town to collect the blood of the animals they butcher has not been as abundant as it once was, for the past few months  
--- is not happy with the accord/Whispering Court  
  
  
* as they talk to people, someone realises that a spectator is actually there as a spy to gather information and dob them into the authorities  
* they notice that [[Felgan]] is there with a couple of other [[Neighbourhood Watch ]] and [[Laundithas]]
* [[Felgan]] actually wants to try and shut the club down so she can take it over/start one of her own with the Automatons running it
* she has tampered with armor, and the magical wards




[[Rorick]] 
- He shares that he had received a warning letter that the fighters would start to die
	- This would be bad for the Red Caps, not because of the money, but because the blood source would eventually dry up
- Asks the party to help and investigate. He suggests:
	- head to the [[Fight Club Club#9. Armory]], see if the guards on duty here saw anyone tampering with the armor
	- look into:
		- [[Gnarl Bloodclaw]] who is unhappy with how boring the fights are for him
		- [[Raddicus]], his assistant manager, who has challenged him for ownership 


- Asks to leave [[Fawn]] and [[Achroteth]] to guard the armor, only ones to be trusted.

- [[Felgan]] is working with both parties, trying to play them against each other and eventually buy the club
	- she noticed that certain townsfolk were making some good money working for the Red Caps so knew that the club must be successful, and she deserves to own it
	- figured that if [[Finroth Tilvenar]] knew about it, he would want it shut down, so would help her persuade the owner to sell it
	- added a little more chaos to help her cause
	- will be devastated to learn that it doesn't really turn a big profit, the money is invested back into the people that work and fight there, keeping the drinks low etc

##### Clues

[[Raddicus]] 
- feels limited by [[Rorick]]'s short sightedness, wants even more blood spilled to bring even more Red Caps to town and expand their operation.
- [[Raddicus]] is unhappy that [[Rorick]] has dismissed the talks to provide the Automatons to do work around the club
	- knows that it may make it cheaper and easier to run the club though, and will make it more efficient with getting the blood they need
- knows that the club is not making as much as it could, the money is invested back into the people that work and fight there, keeping the drinks low etc but think about how much more they can help the Fae if they had more money.
	- has been in talks with a very helpful and successful merchant who has helped him see the potential the club can make
		- describes the merchant as a lady wearing a green cloak.
- [[Raddicus]] was in the staff room at the time, can ask anyone there and will verify it
	- Can be verified by other Red Caps - on the way past there will head past the animal pen


[[Gnarl Bloodclaw]]
- isn't interested in talking unless they have been in fights and proved their worth
	- [[Intimidation]] check (DC 15) will impress him and will share info
- became a fighter after being taken in by [[Rorick]] when he was a young pup, has a lot of love and affection for [[Rorick]]
	- He lost his brood during the plague
- [[Rorick]] is like a father, but at his age he must challenge and prove himself
- He has heard that Automatons are tough fighters so is keen to see what they can do in the ring
	- "Some lady in a green cloak told me about the Automatons, but when I spoke to [[Rorick]] he wasn't interested"
- was in the [[Fight Club Club#8. Fighter Training area]] sparring with another fighter, can ask anyone there and will verify it
	- Can be verified by other fighters - on the way past there will head past the animal pen


[[Laundithas]]
- overheard a conversation between [[Finroth Tilvenar|Finroth]] and someone in a green cloak about this place
- sounded like a great opportunity to sell some more Automaton contracts
- when [[Finroth Tilvenar|Finroth]] heard he was coming here suggested he take a few members of the [[Neighbourhood Watch]] to help keep him safe


[[Felgan]] 
* she noticed that certain townsfolk were making some good money working for the Red Caps so knew that the club must be successful, and she deserves to own it
- figured that if [[Finroth Tilvenar]] knew about it, he would want it shut down, so would help her persuade the owner to sell it.
- was upstairs with [[Laundithas]] the whole evening

When presented with evidence:
- she admits she added a little more chaos to help her cause - won't revel what though, "they will just have to wait and see" 
	- (have [[Rinji]]'s next fight be announced - with [[Byll & Teadd]])
- is working with both parties, trying to play them against each other and eventually buy the club
- will be devastated to learn that it doesn't really turn a big profit




**[[Fight Club Club#9. Armory]]**
- someone has disrupted the magical weaves of the armor
- guard was off talking to a friend to place some bets for him, (against the rules) thought no one would notice, begs for them not to say anything doesn't want to get in trouble
	- friend was wearing a green cloak, a member of the [[Neighbourhood Watch]]
- to get to the armory, must go past the [[Fight Club Club#12. Animal Pen]]


**[[Fight Club Club#12. Animal Pen]]**
- A Red Cap named [[Rebeckna]] can be seen tending to some animals and monstrosities in cages.
- If asked, says that two fighters in green cloaks came through, sneaking about, but told them they weren't allowed in here
- her only job is to look after these creatures, which she loves doing. She rescues them from the forest, but can't save them all, have been a lot more of these creatures needing help lately
- [[Rorick]] Said he would free the animals once they have returned to full health and could protect themselves from whatever is out there


**[[Fight Club Club#13. Staff Room]]**


**[[Fight Club Club#8. Fighter Training area]]** 



[[Felgan]] can be overheard complaining that all their sabotaging has been for naught, it seems to be spurring on the crowd rather than drive them away, they need to try something more sinister.

Will try to let loose all the monstrosities in the pens




[[Byll & Teadd]] were ordered to fight by [[Felgan]] in an exhibition match

They are scared, they are not really great fighters.




  
  
- traps/puzzle/challenge  
-- magic wards  
-- damage limiting armour, tangled with (either to turn on for the head line fight, or turned off for the 3rd fight)  
  
- secrets/clues  
-- the red caps need to wash their caps in the blood from the fights to stay alive  
-- used to have an agreement with the farmers for the blood of their livestock when butchered, they don't have as much to sell now  
-- they refuse to make the same deal with the Automatons and see them as unnatural  
-- people who fight do so to afford blackmarket supplies, e.g. seed, fertiliser etc  
  
- loot  
-- leather armour that will prevent the wearer from dropping to 0hp, this requires a blood soaked Red Cap hat wiped over a magical rune on the armour to recharge this property. Requires a d20 roll, starting at DC 1. Every subsequent succes increases the DC by 1.

# **Redcap Hat**

> [!abstract] **Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)**
>
> The Redcap Hat is a sinister-looking piece of headgear, woven from coarse, blood-stained fabric. The hat was once worn by a Redcap, an evil fey creature known for its bloodlust and malevolent nature. When donned, the hat retains a connection to the dark power of its former owner, granting the wearer a taste of the Redcap's brutal strength.
>
> While wearing the Redcap Hat, the player gains the following abilities:
>
> ---
>
> **Bloodthirsty Ritual (Bonus Action):**
>
> Once per combat, the wearer of the Redcap Hat can use a bonus action to smear the hat in the blood of a creature that has lost HP during the current combat. If the creature is still conscious and not incapacitated, it must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier). On a failed save, the creature is momentarily weakened, and the player gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + their Constitution modifier. These temporary hit points last until the end of combat.
>
> ---
>
> **Additional Properties:**
> 
> - **Sinister Aura:** While attuned to the Redcap Hat, the player has an advantage on Intimidation checks but a disadvantage on Persuasion checks.
> - **Fey Resilience:** The wearer of the Redcap Hat has resistance to cold iron (non-magical iron weapons) while wearing the hat.
> - **Curse:** Unbeknownst to the wearer, the Redcap Hat harbors a subtle curse. Each time the hat's Bloodthirsty Ritual is used, the wearer must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the wearer becomes increasingly bloodthirsty, suffering from bloodlust until they can rest (after a long rest). During this time, they must attack a creature with the lowest current HP on the battlefield or suffer 1d6 psychic damage at the end of their turn.
>
> ---
>
> **Lore:**
>
> The Redcap Hat is a grim trophy taken from a particularly cruel Redcap known as *Blood-Boot*. Its dark powers are fueled by the blood of those it touches, and it subtly influences the wearer, drawing them closer to the Redcap's wicked nature. Despite its benefits, the hat is feared by many, for it carries a price that only the strong-willed can resist.
>
> ---
>
> **Quest Hook:** The player might need to find a way to cleanse the hat of its curse or learn to master its bloodthirsty influence. An ancient druid or a wise fey might hold the secret to either taming or purifying the Redcap Hat.
