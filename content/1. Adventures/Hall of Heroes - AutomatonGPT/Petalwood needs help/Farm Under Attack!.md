Tracking the animals takes you through the forest surrounding Petalwood. The trees stand tall, over 40 ft tall, with the branches providing a canopy that provides welcome cover from the overhead sun.  
  
You hear sparingly, the calls of wild birds and the shuffle of small feet moving hurridly away from you.  
  
As you trek deeper into the forrest you start to notice that the shade overhead starts to thin, with leaves missing and the evidence of trees being removed from the ground.  
  
As you continue to stare up at the trees to survey your cover you notice movement in the branches.  
  
You hear hooting and grunting, and the movement starts to become more erratic as a shrewdness of apes appear above and around you.  
  
These apes look already hurt and injured.  
  
Ape attack!  
Awakened Shrubs join the fight.  
  
You continue to follow the tracks and it eventually leads you to a stream. As you look at the stream you see signs that this stream is not flowing as strong as it perhaps did in the past.  
  
Following the stream you come across a cave, hidden away in a rock formation.  
  
Inside the cave is a large grotto with a single majestic tree. You can see this tree once shimmered and illuminate the whole cave, but that shimmer is wavering and leaves one by one are falling and gathering around the base of the tree.  
  
From the leaves an alluring humanoid form arises, you can't tell if it is just covered in the leaves or if the leaves are a part of their skin.  
  
The creature investigates the tree with a soft grace, slow moving arms reach out to touch the leaves, a hand placed delicately on the bark as if the creature listens for a heartbeat.  
  
The creatures starts to tremble violently and whips their head around, searching for something.
