# Quicksand
*Wilderness Hazard*  

A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a 10-foot square area and is usually 10 feet deep. When a creature enters the area, it sinks `1d4+1` feet into the quicksand and becomes [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another `1d4` feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, it can escape by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand. A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand can't breathe (see the "suffocation" rules in the *Player's Handbook*).

A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using its action and succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk into the quicksand.
