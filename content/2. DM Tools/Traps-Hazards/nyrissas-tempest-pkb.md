# Nyrissa's Tempest
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Trap*

Sudden dark clouds gather in the sky, and moments later, lightning and tornadoes attempt to rip the landscape apart. The trap is triggered when the PCs complete any attempt to disable the tempest, or 10 minutes pass without any attempt to leave the area (whichever comes first).

Bolts of lightning lance down from above. If the PCs managed to succeed at a DC 18 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) or Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check to prepare for the storm, they find shelter and only one PC (determined randomly) is targeted by this bolt, otherwise all PCs are targeted by bolts. PCs must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then, whether or not the PCs managed to take shelter, roll initiative for *Nyrissa's tempest*.

If the PCs successfully sought shelter by succeeding at a Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check, the storm takes no actions. Otherwise, the storm takes four of the following actions, each determined by rolling a `d6` during the round. On each successive round, the number of actions the storm takes is reduced by 1; when the storm is reduced to 0 actions in this way, the hazard ends.

## 1–2 Thunderclap

A blast of sound rips through the region. Unsheltered PCs must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) thunder damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## 3–4 Lightning

The tempest blasts the PCs with lightning as detailed above.

## 5–6 Tornado

A tornado funnel extends down from the storm to unerringly strike at a PC, who must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 32 (`8d6`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creature can make a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to break free on the first round. If this effort is unsuccessful, the following round on the trap's turn, the creature is hurled through the air, taking 32 (`8d6`) bludgeoning damage, and falls `1d6 × 10` feet, taking 4 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet fallen. The creature lands [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
