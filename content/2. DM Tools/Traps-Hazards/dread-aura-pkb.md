# Dread Aura
*Magical Trap*  

A disturbing sensation of having attracted the unwanted attention of something unimaginably powerful grows increasingly overwhelming as a creature lingers in the area.

A creature ending its turn in the ruins of the tower while not currently affected by the Dread Aura must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or feel as if it has attracted the attention of something very powerful. A creature that fails this saving throw has disadvantage on all saving throws against effects that would make it [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) so long as they remain within the hex containing Candlemere. A creature that succeeds its saving throw is immune to the Dread Aura for 24 hours.

A creature that succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) ability check can inscribe eldritch warding sigils on the stones of the tower, disabling the Dread Aura. Alternatively banishing the Thresholder influence in the chambers below will cause the Dread Aura to dissipate.
