# Test of Tactics
*Magical Trap*  

Obscure magical runes, noticed with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, are hidden within the runes of the sixteen named warriors. The runes bind a pair of [derghodaemons](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/derghodaemon-pkb.md) into the walls of this hallway. When a creature moves past the bend in the middle of the hall, two [derghodaemons](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/derghodaemon-pkb.md) rise up from the floor to the north and southeast near the stairs. The monsters fight to the death but do not pursue foes out of this area.

If at least one of the [derghodaemons](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/derghodaemon-pkb.md) survives, the trap resets after 1 hour, causing the surviving monsters to regain all their hit points, lose all conditions and lasting effects on them, and return to their binding locations.

Disabling the runes requires a successful DC 18 Intelligence ([Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check. The trap can also be disabled by casting [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 16), or by banishing or defeating both [derghodaemons](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/derghodaemon-pkb.md).
