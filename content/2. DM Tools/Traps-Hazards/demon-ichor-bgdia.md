# Demon Ichor
*Generic Hazard*  

Demon ichor is what remains behind after a demon dies. It's a reduction of demonic blood, viscera, and bodily fluids with the consistency and odor of bile.

Enough demons die in Avernus that their ichor forms pools and small lakes. Although the ichor is harmless on most planes of existence, it can warp creatures on the Lower Planes. Devils and other creatures have found ways to use demon ichor in rituals and to improve the performance of infernal war machines (as described in appendix B).

When a creature comes in direct contact with demon ichor in Avernus, it must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Fiends, oozes, plants, and undead automatically succeed on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically warped by the ichor, as determined by rolling on the Flesh Warping table. A spell that removes a curse ends all ichor-related warping effects on a creature.

## Ichor-Coated Weapons

Demon ichor is sticky enough to adhere to most weapons. A creature in Avernus that takes damage from a weapon coated with demon ichor suffers a flesh-warping transformation if it fails its saving throw (as described above). After hitting its target, the weapon is no longer coated with demon ichor.

| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 01–05 | The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned. |
| 06–10 | The target's eyes push out of its head on the end of stalks. |
| 11–15 | The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers. |
| 16–20 | One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet. |
| 21–25 | The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open. |
| 26–30 | A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet. |
| 31–35 | The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened). |
| 36–40 | Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks. |
| 41–45 | The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1). |
