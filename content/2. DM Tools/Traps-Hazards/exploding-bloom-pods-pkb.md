# Exploding Bloom Pods
*Generic Hazard*  

Moving too quickly through the bed of pods causes them to shudder, emit eerie gurgling sounds, and then burst. These bloom pods have AC 12, 66 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to poison damage.

If a Small or larger creature moves at normal speed through the area or the pods are reduced to half their hit points, the pods explode into a burst of toxic foliage, mold, and poisonous vapors. All creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, while all creatures in the ten-foot-wide tunnel leading to the south can make the saving throw with advantage. On a failed saving throw, creatures take 21 (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and 21 (`6d6`) poison damage. A creature takes half the amount of damage on a successful save.
