# Test of Agility
*Mechanical Trap*  

A creature who succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check spots this trap. When a creature or object of at least Small size moves onto the floor of the room, the floor pitches and rolls. The triggering creature must attempt a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature falls [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) and must repeat the saving throw. If the creature fails by 5 or more, the creature falls into one of the two spiked pits to the north or south of the room, falling 10 feet and taking 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage plus 11 (`2d10`) piercing damage from the spikes. A character that succeeds can make a DC 13 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to move normally, treating the floor as difficult terrain on a failed check.

A creature that begins its turn on the moving floor must repeat its saving throws. Scraps of material or pitons can be wedged into the edges of the room to hamper the floor's tilt; this requires four successes on a DC 13 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) or ([Sleight of Hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, which can be performed by multiple characters. If not disabled, the trap continues to function continuously.
