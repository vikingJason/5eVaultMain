# Teleport Trap
*Magical Trap*  

The House at the Edge of Time folds time and space back on the target, who teleports painfully into their own body an instant before they travel. The magical effect is subtle, requiring a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to notice the magical energies. When a non-native of Thousandbreaths attempts to teleport in any area within the House at the Edge of Time, the House redirects the magic to cause the creature that attempted the teleportation action to instead teleport into themselves. The creature must attempt a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 49 (`9d10`) psychic damage and 49 (`9d10`) force damage. If the creature fails its save by 5 or more, any creatures that would have been teleported with it take the damage as well. On a success, the teleportation fails.

This trap cannot be disabled as long as [Nyrissa](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/nyrissa-pkb.md) lives, but if she is slain or forgiven, the teleport trap vanishes.
