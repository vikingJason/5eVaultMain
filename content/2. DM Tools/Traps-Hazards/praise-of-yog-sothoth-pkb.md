# Praise of Yog-Sothoth
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Trap*

Magical letters reveal phrases in Aklo that, if not properly spoken aloud, inflict numbing cold. Creatures spending more than one round in the area must make a DC 20 Intelligence ([Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check three times in a row to successfully speak aloud the esoteric phrases as they appear. If successful, the trap deactivates for one hour. If the creature fails these checks, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 48 (`12d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

At the start of each round, the trap fills the entirety of the area with additional blasts of cold. All creatures in the area are subject to the same effects listed on page 186 ^[This is a homebrew addition, replacing the following: above]. Creatures that fail two subsequent saving throws are [stunned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of their next turn.

Creatures can detect the trap by succeeding on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, or by casting [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md). In addition to speaking the Aklo phrases, it can be disabled by casting [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (treating the trap as a 9th-level spell).
