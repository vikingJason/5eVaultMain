# Deadly Yellow Mold
*Generic Hazard*  

Noticing this fungus requires a creature to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check reveals the characteristics of the dangerous mold spores. If a creature moves through the mold or damages it with anything other than fire, the fungus releases spores in a 10-foot cube centered on the creature. All creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (`5d10`) poison damage and is [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature takes 11 (`2d10`) poison damage at the beginning of its turn. At the end of each of its turns, it can make a new saving throw, ending the effect for itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its initial saving throw takes half damage and is not [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). Any amount of fire damage, or direct sunlight, will kill one patch of the fungus.
