# Eldritch Echoes
*Magical Trap*  

Eerie sounds ring out and those who listen for too long become convinced that these forces can be defeated by lashing out at them, even though whatever or whoever is responsible is not apparent. When at least two creatures who aren't native to Thousandbreaths end their turn in the area, those in the room begin "hearing" the sounds in the room telepathically and start to have difficulty telling the difference between these sounds and those of their allies.

The trap starts scrambling senses and forcing creatures to perceive threats to their very place in time and space where no such threats actually exist. Every creature in the area must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns. Creatures that fail this saving throw become confused as per the [confusion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell until the end of their next turn. Creatures that succeed the saving throw are unaffected.

A creature that succeeds on a DC 19 Charisma ([Intimidation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) or Charisma ([Performance](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance)) ability check counters these eerie sounds by exceeding their influence, startling the echoes into silence with a dazzling display or fit of rage. Once disabled, the trap does not manifest again.
