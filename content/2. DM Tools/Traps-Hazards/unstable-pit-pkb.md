# Unstable Pit
*Mechanical Trap*  

This open pit was once hidden by branches but is now clearly visible. However, its unstable edges are not as obvious, posing a hidden danger. A successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check allows a creature to note the crumbling edges before it gets too close. Otherwise, a creature moving within 5 feet of the pit's edge causes the edge to crumble. The creature must succeed at a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the 10-foot-deep pit, taking 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature does not fall into the pit, but instead falls [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) next to it. An adjacent creature—so long as it is not within 5 feet of the pit—can attempt a DC 12 Strength check to catch the creature, keeping it from falling [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) if successful.
