# Frozen Moment
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Trap*

Warding magic attempts to trap intruders or would-be thieves in a temporal disruption. A creature that touches the warded object or area triggers the trap, and all creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be trapped in a disrupted time flow. Affected creatures' minds move so quickly that each round seems to last a century, but their bodies and magical energies move so slowly that they can't take actions. An affected creature can make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw for every minute of real time that passes while the creature is trapped in the frozen moment, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The magical ward can be spotted with a successful DC 18 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. A creature that succeeds at a DC 20 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check disables the trap, though a failed check triggers it. [Dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) can negate the trap as it is triggered or can end its effects for a single creature, treating the trap as a 9th-level spell.
