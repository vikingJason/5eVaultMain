# Smoke-Filled Hallway
*Generic Hazard*  

Thick smoke fills this hallway, making it difficult to see and breathe. A creature that enters the hallway for the first time or begins its turn there must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A creature who has immediate access to water (such as from a filled waterskin) can cover the nose and mouth with a wet cloth to help alleviate the choking effects of the smoke, gaining advantage on the saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature is [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute and takes 3 (`1d6`) poison damage. A creature that is reduced to 0 hit points is [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and stable but must be dragged to safety to avoid taking further damage.

The smoke continues to affect anyone who enters the area until the fires are extinguished.
