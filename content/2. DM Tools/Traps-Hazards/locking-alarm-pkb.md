# Locking Alarm
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Trap*

This trap is placed on a door. Any attempt to open the door or affect it with magic without first tracing the symbol of Yhidothrus (an hourglass) on the door's face with a fingertip causes a glowing green ward to seal the door shut and raise an alarmâ€”the sound of a shrieking tormented soul. This howl is loud enough to alert nearby foes. Once triggered, the alarm continues to shriek and the door remains locked until the hazard is disabled or the door is destroyed or opened. Tracing Yhidothrus's hourglass-shaped religious symbol on either side of the door with a fingertip disables the alarm and the locking ward.

Creatures can detect the locking arm by succeeding at a DC 15 Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check. They can disarm it by succeeding at a DC 17 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check or by casting [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (treating the trap as a 5th-level spell). The door is made of stone with AC 17 and 100 hit points.
