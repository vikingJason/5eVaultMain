# Ballista Defense
*Mechanical Trap*  

This is one of several ballistae that augment the defenses of King Irovetti's Palace in Pitax. If the alarm is raised while the PCs approach the palace, guards ready and load the ballista firing on any targets within range on their initiative. With a team of at least three guards attending the ballista, the weapon can be reloaded and fired each round.

## Ballista

*Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120/480 ft., one target. *Hit:*  16 (`3d10`) piercing damage.

The ballista has AC 15 and 50 hit points. However, it fires through an arrow slit in the castle wall and has three-quarters cover from attacks originating from outside the wall. Attempting to sabotage the ballista's firing mechanism through the arrow slit from outside the wall requires a successful DC 25 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check. If the same check is attempted from inside the room with the ballista, the DC is 15.

There are four guards stationed at the ballista. If two or more of the guards are made to leave their post or are incapacitated or killed, the efficiency of the ballista is compromised. At least three guards are needed to maintain its optimal firing rate. If only two guards attend the ballista, they must spend an action to reload and aim, allowing the weapon to fire only every other round. If only a single guard attends the weapon, they must spend an action to reload, another to aim, and one to fire, allowing a shot only once every 3 rounds.
