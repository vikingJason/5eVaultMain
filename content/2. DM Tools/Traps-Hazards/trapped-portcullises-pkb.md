# Trapped Portcullises
*Mechanical Trap*  

If all four boulders are placed within six minutes, the doors open. Otherwise, all four steps angle downward, causing any boulders held within to roll forward. Each creature in the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature is struck by a rolling boulder for 55 (`10d10`) bludgeoning damage and falls [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

A character can attempt to disable the hinges for one of the steps, thereby locking all four steps in place. Detecting the mechanism requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check, while disabling the trap requires a successful DC 13 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check. A failure by 5 or more triggers the hinge mechanism, causing the trap to trigger prematurely.

If the trap is bypassed by successfully opening the doors, it resets after 24 hours.
