# Cutthroat Haunt
*Magical Trap*  

The pain endured by Abbot Ildeben as [the Gardener](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/the-gardener-pkb.md) cut his throat lingers in this room. If a creature comes within 5 feet of the bloodstain in the center of the room where Abbot Ildeben died, a spectral sickle manifests behind that creature and attempts to cut the creature's throat.

A creature that has its throat cut in this way must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (`10d10`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature taking damage in this way has its hit point maximum reduced by the amount of damage it took. This reduction lasts until the creature takes a long rest. Once this haunt manifests, it won't manifest again for another hour.

A creature must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma ([Persuasion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) ability check to appeal to the haunt and convince it that the party isn't the source of its pain. A creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) ability check to rebuke the haunt in Cayden Cailean's name. If either check is successful, the haunt is disabled and will not manifest again.
