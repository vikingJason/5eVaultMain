# Collapsing Floor
*Mechanical Trap*  

If a Small or larger creature walks into either five-foot square at the westernmost end of the building, the floor collapses, dropping the creature and rubble into the depths below unless the creature succeeds on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 35 (`10d6`) bludgeoning damage from the fall, plus an additional 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage from the collapsing timbers.

A successful DC 19 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check must be made to notice the weak wall supports surrounding the floor. These areas can be jury-rigged with supports to prevent the collapse with a successful DC 19 Dexterity check. A failed check triggers the floor's collapse.
