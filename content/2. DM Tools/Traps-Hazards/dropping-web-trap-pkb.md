# Dropping Web Trap
*Mechanical Trap*  

A 30-foot-wide web bridge spans a 30-foot-deep mountain chasm. A creature who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check recognizes the bridge is in fact loose. The bridge collapses when one Large, two Medium, or three Small creatures move onto the it. Creatures on the bridge when it collapses fall 30 feet and take 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage.

Securing the bridge in place so that it can be crossed safely requires a creature to succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check. Once the bridge has collapsed, a creature must succeed at a DC 13 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to set it up again.
