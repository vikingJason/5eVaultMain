# Crimson Slime
*Environmental Hazard*  

This slime mold is bright red with darker blotches scattered over its surface. Crimson slime is usually encountered in warm, heavily forested areas or deep underground in areas full of living creatures for its spores. Crimson slime typically covers a 5-foot square. When a living creature moves within 10 feet of a crimson slime, the dark splotches on its surface burst and release spores in a 10-foot-radius around itself (see the [crimson shambler's](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/crimson-shambler-tob2.md) Spores trait for the effects of the spores). Ingestion of or physical contact with the crimson slime will also cause exposure to the spores. Crimson slime is immune to acid. Any effect that cures a disease or deals cold or fire damage destroys a path of crimson slime.
