# Stinging Nettle
*Generic Hazard*  

This bright green plant has long triangular leaves covered with fine hair-like stingers, noticed with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. A creature must attempt a DC 12 Constitution save if they're walking through the square or a DC 15 Constitution save if they touched the nettles. On a failed save, the creature is [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned); the [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature who succeeds at a DC 12 Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check identifies the nettles and their properties. A successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check allows a creature to carefully navigate the plant and pull aside or cut away the nettles.
