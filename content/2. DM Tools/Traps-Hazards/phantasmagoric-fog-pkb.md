# Phantasmagoric Fog
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Trap*

A creature that moves through the undergrowth triggers this trap. Once triggered, cloying, violet mist billows from the undergrowth, filling the heads of any creatures inside with maddening visions of dark, moonless nights; twisted, malignant trees; and hot, steaming rivers of blood. One round later, the hall fills with violet fog that causes the affected creature to have disadvantage on [Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception) checks. Any creature entering the affected area is exposed to the phantasmagoric fog. If the fog is inhaled, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom save or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks and saves, as well as on attack rolls with spells. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

This trap cannot be disarmed, but it can be avoided by making a successful DC 17 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to find a path through the Grand Hall that doesn't disturb the undergrowth.

Phantasmagoric fog resets after an hour.
