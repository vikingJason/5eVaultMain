# Stygian Fires
*Magical Trap*  

The magical connection between the doors and the lanterns is not readily visible, requiring a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to notice. A DC 16 Intelligence ([Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check reveals there is divine magic at work. If the doors to the next area are opened without making the blood offerings and lighting the lanterns, every creature in this area must attempt a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 55 (`10d10`) cold damage.

The trap can be disabled by using prayer to deactivate the divine magic. This requires a successful DC 16 Intelligence ([Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check; on a failure by 5 or more, the trap is triggered. [Dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) can be used to disable the trap (treating the trap as a 5th-level spell).
