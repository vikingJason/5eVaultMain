# Breeg's Traps
*Mechanical Trap*  

Several dozen hidden bear traps are scattered across this area. A trap is triggered when a creature steps on it, causing the trap to snap shut on the creature's leg. The creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or it takes 5 (`1d10`) piercing damage and is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) so long as the trap is spiked into the ground. The trap can be pulled loose from the ground with a successful DC 12 Strength check. The creature is no longer [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) but moves at half movement until the trap is removed from its leg. A creature, whether the trapped creature or an ally, with hands or other manipulative digits can make a DC 13 Strength check, removing the trap from the creature's leg on a success. A failed check deals another 2 piercing damage to the trapped creature.

The traps are hidden beneath undergrowth and leaf litter, requiring a successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice. Once aware of a trap, a creature can safely disarm it by applying force to the pressure trigger, pushing on it with a staff or other object, or tossing a heavy object like a stone onto the trigger.

A PC must succeed at a DC 13 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check to locate and disable all the traps in this area. The traps can be reset and triggered up to 5 times before they are considered used up.
