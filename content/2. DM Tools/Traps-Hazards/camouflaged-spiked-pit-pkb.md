# Camouflaged Spiked Pit
*Mechanical Trap*  

This is a 20-foot deep, funnel-shaped pit lined with dozens of wooden spikes and camouflaged by a cloth covered in dirt and twigs. A creature must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice the pit. A creature moving onto the cloth falls into the pit unless they succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage from rolling down the steep decline, plus 22 (`4d10`) piercing damage from contact with the spikes on the way down.

Once a creature has fallen into the trap, or the discovered cover has been removed, it is no longer camouflaged until the covering has been replaced. The pit is easily seen and avoided once uncovered, but the only way to disable it is to fill in the hole.
