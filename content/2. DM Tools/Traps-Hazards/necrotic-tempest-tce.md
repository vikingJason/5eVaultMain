# Necrotic Tempest
*Eldritch Storm*  

Storms infused with the essence of death roil with dark clouds that manifest leering skulls and bone-white lightning. Any creature exposed to the storm that isn't a construct or an undead must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of each minute or take `3d6` necrotic damage.

A creature that dies in a necrotic tempest rises as a [skeleton](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) or [zombie](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) (your choice) `1d10` minutes later.

 A necrotic tempest lasts for `1d4` hours and leaves crops withered and wells undrinkable for `1d4` days after its passing.
