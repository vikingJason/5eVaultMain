# Spiral Seal
*Generic Hazard*  

A spiral shape suggesting the curling religious symbol of Pharasma is carved into the stone floor. The Spiral Seal can be targeted as an object, and has AC 19 and 106 hit points. Once per turn, when the seal is damaged or an attempt to disable it fails, the magic stored within the Spiral Seal blasts outward in a concussive wave of power. All creatures within 60 feet of the Spiral Seal must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, falling [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) on a failed save.

At the start of each round, if the seal has at least 1 hit point, it regains 15 hit points.

The seal can be disabled by casting [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (treating the trap as a 6th-level spell) or by destroying it.
