# Azure Lilies
*Generic Hazard*  

These blue-tinted lilies expel a burst of toxic pollen whenever the lily patch is disturbed. The lilies have AC 17, 120 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to poison damage.

When disturbed, the lilies erupt in a 30-foot radius of pollen. Any creatures caught in this area must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 42 (`12d6`) psychic damage as the pollen causes wracking headaches and jolts of pain. Furthermore, any creature failing its Wisdom saving throw is confused as per the [confusion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell for 1 minute. The creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end this effect. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half damage and is not confused.

A DC 17 Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) ability check is necessary to spot the danger the azure lilies pose as well as to successfully harvest the pollen without triggering the hazard. Regardless of whether or not the hazard is triggered or the pollen is harvested, the pollen regrows and is ready to use again given 1 month. The only way to stop this from happening is to destroy the azure lilies by reducing them to 0 hit points.
