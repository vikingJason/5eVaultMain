# Lights of the Lost
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Trap*

Slain priests manifest as balls of floating, blood-red wine, each offering a glimpse at the visage of a face screaming silently within. A creature opening any of the doors into a priest's cell activates this trap. Every creature in the room must attempt a DC 18 Wisdom save as waves of fear wash through the area and all creatures in the room realize that, one by one, their loved ones are being murdered and that they will be the last to be slain. If the creature's save is successful, it becomes frightened for 1 minute. If it fails, it is both frightened for 1 minute and stunned until the end of its next turn.

Up to four different creatures in the room are each targeted by one of the floating, churning spheres of wine drifting through the air; each sphere hurtles toward a creature and douses them with wine that quickly turns to life-draining blood. The haunt cannot target the same creature more than once each round. A creature targeted by the lights of the lost must make a DC 18 Constitution save, taking 32 (`8d6`) necrotic damage, becoming poisoned, and gaining one level of exhaustion on a failed save. A creature takes half the amount of damage, is not poisoned, and gains no levels of exhaustion on a successful save.

The haunt has 150 hit points, an armor class of 18, and all of its abilities are all (4) for the purposes of making saving throws. Once the haunt is reduced to less than 75 hit points, it can target no more than two different creatures.

This trap can be detected with a successful DC 18 Investigation check, and it can be disabled by casting dispel magic (treating the trap as a 7th-level spell). After it has been triggered, creatures can attempt to end the effect by making a successful DC 20 Persuasion [...] ^[The following text has been removed with this homebrew: Diplomacy] check and promising the unquiet spirits that justice will be served and the cause of their pain will be punished. Otherwise, a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Religion) check invokes Cayden Cailean to calm the spirits.

This trap automatically resets after an hour.
