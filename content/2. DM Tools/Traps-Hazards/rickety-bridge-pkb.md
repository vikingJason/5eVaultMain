# Rickety Bridge
*Generic Hazard*  

The bridge is old and in disrepair, groaning alarmingly when crossed. If 2 or more Medium, or a Large or larger creature attempts to cross the bride, it collapses, dumping the creatures into the river below. A creature grabbing a loose handhold must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to grab a safe handhold, or it falls to the bottom of the chasm 20 feet below, taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage.

The waters under the bridge churn violently until the end of the round following the bridge collapse, causing any creatures in the water to have disadvantage on Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks made to swim.
