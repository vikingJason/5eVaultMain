# Web Lurker Noose Trap
*Mechanical Trap*  

This cunning trap is the creation of a web lurkerâ€”a canny spider-like aberration capable of crafting dangerous traps from the silk it spins from its own body. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices this trap. When a creature walks into the same space as the web tripwire, the trap makes an attack with a +7 bonus to hit. On a hit, the target takes 12 (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage and is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15). A creature takes 5 (`1d10`) bludgeoning damage at the end of each of its turns it is still [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled).

A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) or Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check can disable the trap. On a failure, the trap triggers against the character making the attempt. The noose can be destroyed; it has AC 11 and 10 hit points and is immune to bludgeoning and has resistance to piercing unless the GM determines otherwise based on the attempt. Damaging the trap and failing to break it triggers the trap.
