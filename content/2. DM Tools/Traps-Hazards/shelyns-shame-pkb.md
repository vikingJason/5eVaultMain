# Shelyn's Shame
*Magical Trap*  

*Haunt Trap*

When a Small or larger creature enters the pool or touches the statue, the statue begins to weep, its tears running in rivulets down into the surrounding pool, attempting to fill all creatures nearby with overwhelming shame and grief. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check notices the tears pouring from the statue's eyes. The triggering creature and all other creatures within 20 feet of that creature must attempt a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If the save is attempted by a worshipper of Shelyn, the save is made with advantage.

On a failed save, feelings of sadness and despair well up in the creature's mind. For the next hour, the creature is cursed with disadvantage on Charisma and Wisdom saving throws. On a success, a creature is immune to the effect for 24 hours, and the character can make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Insight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. A creature that succeeds on the [Insight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight) check is filled with an urge to defeat the evil that has infested the shrine, as well as the urge to restore the shrine. Exact details as to the nature of the evil infesting the shrine don't become apparent, other than to alert the character that there's certainly something dire within the shrine's walls.
