# Weakened Floor
*Generic Hazard*  

This section of cave floor has eroded over time, making it dangerous walk on despite appearing solid. A Small or larger creature entering the marked area causes the unstable floor there to collapse. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, or falls 40 feet into a chasm filled with stalagmites, taking 14 (`4d6`) bludgeoning damage from the fall plus 11 (`2d10`) piercing damage from the stalagmites.

A successful DC 14 Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check indicates the presence of the unstable floor. A successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check can be used to knock the unstable portion loose, revealing a traversable ledge to the south.
