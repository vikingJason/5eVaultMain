# Paranoia Well
*Magical Trap*  

This trap is triggered when a Small or larger creature ends its turn inside of the area. The trap releases its builtup emotional energy in a silent blast of power. Creatures experience sudden invasive emotions of fear, paranoia, and anger, which well up in the mind, causing companions to take on sinister casts to their no-longer familiar features. All creatures in the area or within 20 feet of its exterior walls must make a DC 20 Wisdom save (creatures within take a âˆ’2 penalty to this save). If successful, the creature treats no other creatures as allies and cannot take actions that require [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) for one hour. If the creature fails the save, the effects are the same as success, but the effect is permanent.

[Remove curse](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) ends the effects of this trap, but if the creature does not receive this within 24 hours, treats all creatures it encounters as hostile enemies and must attack them. The creature will single out former friends or allies when possible.

Creatures can detect this trap with a DC 20 [Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation) check or by casting a [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. It can be avoided by not ending a turn in the area, or by casting [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (treating the trap as a 9th-level spell).
