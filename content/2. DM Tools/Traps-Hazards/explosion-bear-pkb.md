# Explosion Bear
*Magical Trap*  

This animated bear starts to dance, with a magical rune seemingly controlling its movements. The bear has AC 19 and 40 hit points.

The bear dances for three rounds, after which it explodes. Creatures within a 20-foot radius of the bear must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 99 (`18d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The trap is disabled if either [Nyrissa](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/nyrissa-pkb.md) says the words "good bear" to the trap before it finishes its dance, [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) is cast on the rune (treating it as a 5th-level spell), or a PC succeeds on a DC 19 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) or Intelligence ([Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) ability check to erase the rune. A failed ability check sets the explosion off prematurely, as does reducing the bear to less than 20 hit points without reducing it to 0 hit points.
