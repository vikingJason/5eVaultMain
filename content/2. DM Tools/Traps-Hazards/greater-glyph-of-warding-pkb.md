# Greater Glyph of Warding
*Magical Trap*  

A creature attempting to open the desk drawer or the secret door to the nearby area triggers the associated glyph. The [glyph of warding](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/glyph-of-warding.md) targets the creature with a [finger of death](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/finger-of-death.md) spell (save DC 20).

The warding can be spotted with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check. A creature that attempts to remove the glyph must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check to disarm it without triggering it. [Dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) can negate the trap as a 6th-level spell.
