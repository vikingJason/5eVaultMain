# Flooding Room
*Mechanical Trap*  

When the southern secret door is opened or any of the trapdoors in the ceiling are forced open, this trap is triggered. As soon as this occurs, the portcullises to the north and south come crashing down, each consisting of solid iron sheets that form watertight seals. At the same time, the dozen 5-foot-wide trapdoors open in the ceiling. These holes are the mouths of winding tunnels that connect to a second pair of apertures on the submerged side of the island outside, allowing the waters of the Little Sellen River to plunge down into this room, possibly damaging or knocking prone those in the square portion of the room itself (but not in the adjoining hallway) and eventually flooding the entire chamber.

A successful DC 16 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check is required to disable one of the 12 trapdoors and seal it shut; disabling all 12 doors completely deactivates the trap. A DC 14 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check is required to disable one of the watertight portcullises. Spells such as [stone shape](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/stone-shape.md) or [wall of stone](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone.md) can also be used to disable parts of the trap at the GM's discretion. Each portcullis has AC 16 and 70 hit points.

When the trap is triggered, the two secret doors to the cyclops zombie alcoves spring open, releasing zombies into the room. Any creature standing in the central 40-by-40-foot section of the main room must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage from the rushing water. Once the cascade begins it is easy to avoid the flow of water but a creature that deliberately enters the cascade takes 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage.

If all 12 trapdoors are open, the room fills with water at a rate of 1 foot per round. If one of the portcullises is breached, or half of the trapdoors are closed, the trap fills the room at half the rate, and if both occur, it fills at one quarter the rate. The flooding ends and the trap deactivates once the area is filled to the ceilingâ€”at this point, the floodwaters equalize with the external environment and do not continue to flood the rest of the dungeon, but creatures still trapped in the room begin drowning. A Medium or smaller creature can try to swim to freedom through one of the 5-foot-wide tunnels leading to the river but doing so requires navigating 200 feet of flooded tunnels.

This trap cannot be reset without the completion of a major engineering effort.
