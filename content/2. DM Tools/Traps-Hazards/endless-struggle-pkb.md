# Endless Struggle
*Magical Trap*  

Vicious spirits of owlbears and bandits rise up and resume their grisly battle. These spectral figures manifest in a sudden and overwhelming battle of endless violence. The spirits have AC 16, 66 hit points, immunity to necrotic damage, vulnerability to radiant damage, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

The spirits appear when three or more creatures that are Small or larger enter the area. The spectral violence churns and flashes through the room, targeting three separate creatures with ghostly claws, beaks, swords, and arrows. The haunt makes a magical attack against these three creatures with a +9 bonus, dealing 22 (`4d10`) necrotic damage on a successful hit. Additionally, all creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the ghostly apparitions.

A creature must succeed on three DC 16 Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) ability checks to empathize with the bestial spirits and calm them or succeed on two DC 16 Intelligence ([Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)) ability checks to exorcise the haunt and disperse its energy. If disabled or destroyed, the haunt will reset after 24 hours unless [the Beast](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/the-beast-pkb.md) has been slain.
