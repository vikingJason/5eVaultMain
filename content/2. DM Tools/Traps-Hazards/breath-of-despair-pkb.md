# Breath of Despair
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Trap*

The faces carved into the wall exhale slithering tendrils of darkness that writhe and coil in the air. When a non-flying creature moves more than 10 feet into the area, the trap triggers, causing the stone faces to inhale and sap energy from those in the area. All creatures in the affected area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) necrotic damage and becoming enfeebled on a failed save. While enfeebled, a creature deals half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength, and has disadvantage on Strength checks. The enfeeblement lasts until a creature finished a short or long rest, or until removed by [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md). On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half the amount of damage and is not enfeebled.

At the start of the next round, the stone faces exhale a despair-inducing breath. All creatures in the affected area must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) psychic damage and becoming [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of their next turn on a failed save. A [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature must take the [Dash](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action to move out of the area by the safest route it can see, unless there is nowhere for it to move. On a successful saving throw, a creature takes half the amount of damage and is not [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

The trap continues this cycle of inhaling and exhaling as long as a non-flying creature remains in the area, ceasing if there are no creatures in the area for 1 round. Then the trap resets itself after 1 minute.

The trap can be detected with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check and disarmed with a second successful check. A failed check triggers the trap. Detect magic reveals an aura of necromantic magic around the faces in the wall. A successful [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 15) cast on the faces destroys the trap. A single face has AC 17, 10 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage. Completely blocking the mouths of all four faces or destroying all four faces disables the trap.
