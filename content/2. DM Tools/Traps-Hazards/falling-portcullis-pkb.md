# Falling Portcullis
*Mechanical Trap*  

A trip wire under the arch causes the keep's ancient portcullis to slam down, sealing the entrance and alerting the denizens of the keep to the intruder's presence. The portcullis has AC 15 and 56 hit points. The tripwire can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, and disabled with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) or Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check.

If the tripwire is pulled or severed (typically through the action of a person walking through the archway into the area beyond), or an attempt to disable it fails, the portcullis comes crashing down. Any creatures passing under the portcullis or standing below it must attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage. Once the creature takes this damage, the creature is thrust aside to an adjacent square of the PC's choice.

Once the portcullis falls, it can be lifted by a creature who succeeds on a DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) ability check or via the nearby winch.
