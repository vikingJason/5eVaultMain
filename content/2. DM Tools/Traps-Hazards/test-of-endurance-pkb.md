# Test of Endurance
*Magical Trap*  

When a creature fails at an attempt to rotate the Wheel or releases their grip once they have started to rotate it, the room fills with several swirling vortexes of freezing wind. All creatures in the room must make a DC 13 Constitution save. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (`2d6`) cold damage for each revolution the wheel has been rotated and gains one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) if they do not have one.

The trap resets automatically and continues to function until disabled. The trap can be disabled by a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) check to adjust the wheel's mechanisms, or by casting [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) (dispel DC 15).
