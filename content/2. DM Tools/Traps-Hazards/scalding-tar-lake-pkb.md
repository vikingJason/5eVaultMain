# Scalding Tar Lake
*Generic Hazard*  

The dangers of the tar lake are self-evident. Any creature attempting to move through the area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 22 (`4d10`) fire damage.

At the start of each round, the bubbling lake of tar churns and sputters. A randomly determined target within 5 feet of the tar lake must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) fire damage.

A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check recognizes that throwing rocks or other bits of debris into areas within the tar lake that are about to burst allows the lake to vent harmlessly for that round. Permanently disabling the tar pit requires powerful magic or long-term engineering projects (subject to the GM's discretion).
