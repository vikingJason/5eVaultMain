# The Power of Faith
*Magical Trap*  

*Complex Haunt Trap*

The lingering essence of the dwarven worshippers who established this shrine demand deference to Torag and punish those who don't offer it. A character notices the dwarven haunt before entering the room by making a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check as they hear the grumbled mutterings of something within. A character that understands Dwarven can understand whispered prayers to Torag by succeeding at a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

When a creature walks more than 10 feet into the room, a great weight settles on all those in the area, causing them to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target falls prone. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, and is no longer forced to remain prone on a success. Ghostly images of chanting dwarves float through the room, drifting between the creatures in the chamber.

The ghostly images have an initiative bonus of +2. On their turn, they target up to three different creatures in the room, touching their brows and filling that person's head with overwhelming but entirely mental choirs exalting the glory of Torag. The haunt targets prone creatures before other creatures, and a single creature cannot be targeted more than once per round. A targeted creature must attempt a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. Prone creatures make this saving throw with disadvantage. A target takes 11 (`2d10`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The ghostly images continue to attack on their turn until the haunt is disabled.

A character can disarm the trap by succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check to perform the required obeisance. A devotee of Torag has advantage on the check. The spirits can be calmed by succeeding on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check; a character has advantage if they are carrying a holy symbol of Torag or are otherwise recognizable as one of the faithful. A character can also use Turn Undead on the trap as though it were a creature; it has a saving throw bonus of all (+7). Instead of being turned, the trap is deactivated for the duration.

The trap resets and can be triggered again after an hour has passed. It can be permanently deactivated by clearing the fortress of all creatures that don't follow Torag and rededicating it to the god (such as with a friendly casting of hallow).
