# Void Pit
*Magical Trap*  

An ice-rimed pit sits here, with nothing but yawning blackness visible inside. A creature descending or falling into the pit finds an strange barrier at the bottom, a cold membrane that appears as if it could be bypassed. A that touches the barrier is pulled through into the depths of space. The creature can avoid this by succeeding at a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw to grasp the edges of the pit and avoid falling through. Otherwise, the creature falls through a one-way portal into the airless void and begins to suffocate, taking 55 (`10d10`) cold damage that round, and at the end of its turn each consecutive round until it dies or leaves the void. Even if the creature can survive the cold and without air, it is still trapped, drifting, in the vast space between worlds.

A creature trapped in the void is considered to be holding its breath, unless it does not breathe. Only powerful magic such as [plane shift](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) or [wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) can save it. However, as the void is airless, spells with verbal components cannot be cast.

[Dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) can destroy the portal at the bottom of the pit (DC 19), turning it into nothing more than a 10-foot-deep pit.
