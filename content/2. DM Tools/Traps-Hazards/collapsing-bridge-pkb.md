# Collapsing Bridge
*Mechanical Trap*  

This bridge is old and in disrepair. A single broken support will cause the bridge to groan, shake, and then collapse. A support has AC 15 and 5 hit points. If a support is destroyed, any creature on the bridge between the red dotted lines falls 30 feet, into the water or on land, depending on its location. A falling creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage from the fall and 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage from falling debris on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature beneath the bridge when it collapses must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) bludgeoning damage from falling debris on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The bridge cannot be stabilized without full repairs to the structure, which could take weeks. Spells such as [wall of stone](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-stone.md) or [wall of force](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wall-of-force.md) could provide much more immediate, if temporary, support to prevent collapse.
