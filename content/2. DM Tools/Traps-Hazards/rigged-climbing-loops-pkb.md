# Rigged Climbing Loops
*Mechanical Trap*  

These loose handholds rip away if used. A successful DC 12 Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) or Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) will identify the loose handholds. A creature grabbing a loose handhold falls to the bottom of the chasm 20 feet below, taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage. The creature can attempt a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. Success indicates the creature is able to grab another handhold and arrest its fall. On a failure, the creature misses a handhold, or the handhold is loose and tears away.

A creature that succeeds on a DC 12 check while using an appropriate set of tools (including [thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) can anchor a loose climbing loop securely.
