# Void Fungus
*Environmental Hazard*  

Clusters of non-ambulatory [Void fungi](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/void-fungus-tob3.md) are encountered in dark places, growing in 5â€‘foot square patches. A patch sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of a patch must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) for 1 minute. While [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), the creature must move on its turn toward the fungus patch by the safest available route, trying to enter the patch's space. Whenever the creature takes damage from a source other than a [Void fungus](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/void-fungus-tob3.md), the creature can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this patch's charm for the next 24 hours.

A creature that starts its turn in the same space as the fungus loses 9 (`2d8`) hp due to blood loss. A patch of non-ambulatory [Void fungi](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/void-fungus-tob3.md) is instantly destroyed by radiant damage or sunlight.
