1 Weight figures are for Medium weapons. A Small weapon weighs half as much, and a Large weapon weighs twice as much.  
2 A weapon with two types is both types if the entry specifies “and,” or either type (wielder’s choice) if the entry specifies “or.”


## Rare Weapons
### Rare Melee Weapons

Most rare melee weapons are secretive, meant to be concealed or utilize a hidden advantage to take foes by surprise. 

**Assassin’s Gauntlet and Boot Dagger.** At a glance this item seems to be perfectly typical, but it conceals a spring-loaded blade deployed by pressing a switch when it is used to make an attack. A creature observing it only realizes that the item is a weapon with a DC 15 Investigation check (made with disadvantage if the weapon is being worn at the time and not deployed). Once deployed, a bonus action is required to sheathe the blade. You gain an expertise die on your attack roll when you deploy this weapon as part of an attack against a target that is unaware you have it.

**Double Weapon.** Wielded not unlike a quarterstaff, each side of this weapon has a blade, weighted head, or other injurious implement. Most double weapons are two-bladed swords or double-axes, but there have been gnome warriors known to wield hooked hammers and elvish clades specialized in swordspears. Double weapons use the statistics for whichever weapon is used to attack and are considered to have the dual-wielding and parrying properties.

**Mercurial Maul.** The liquid metal inside of the shaft and head of this weapon makes it difficult to wield but all the deadlier in expert hands. The minimum result on a damage die rolled with this weapon is a 2.

**Ring Blade.** This metal hoop has sharpened edges that make it deadly whether thrown or used in hand. In addition, when you throw this weapon, you may make the attack with disadvantage, and on a hit it returns to your hand. 

**Shields.** At the Narrator’s discretion, shields may be treated as rare weapons to gain proficiency with them for attack rolls.

**Sword Pistol.** When this weapon is used to hit a target with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to fire the gun in the handle, gaining a 1d6 expertise die on an immediate ranged weapon attack against the same target.


### Rare Ranged Weapons

Ranged rare weapons require ammunition to use, although some firearms can hold multiple bullets at a time.

**Geared Slingshot.** Constructed much like a crossbow, this shoulder-mounted weapon bears a striking resemblance to a miniature catapult. It is typically used to fire hand-sized rocks but any Tiny object can be used as ammunition instead.

**Ratcheting Crossbow.** This crossbow has a large winding wheel affixed to its drawstring which feeds into extra machinery along the stock that catches and pulls the string back again after it is fired. Winding a ratcheting crossbow for a single bolt requires a bonus action or action, and it can be wound to prepare two bolts. Masterwork ratcheting crossbows can be prepared to fire up to four bolts or be constructed smaller (with statistics like a hand crossbow).

**Revolver.** A revolver can be used to make one ranged attack per bullet loaded into it and requires an action to reload.

**Shotgun.** When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with advantage, the attack becomes a critical hit if both d20 rolls would result in a hit. When this weapon is used to make an attack roll with disadvantage and only one attack roll would result in a hit, you instead deal 1d4 piercing damage (adding no bonuses to damage from ability score modifiers or enchantments)

## Weapon Properties

All weapons may deal the same basic types of damage, but they also have special properties that make each unique. You can only benefit from properties marked with † if you are proficient with the weapon.

**Breaker.** This weapon deals double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis after this property.   

**Compounding.** You use only your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Defensive.** This weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.

**Dual-Wielding**. This weapon is designed to be wielded in concert with another weapon. When wielding another weapon in your main hand that does not have the heavy property, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with this weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting). 

**Finesse.** You may choose to use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Hand-Mounted.** This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage made to resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket, using thieves’ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen components.

**Heavy.** This weapon is too large for Small creatures to use effectively. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. 

**Loading.** This weapon must be loaded before it can be used. You may only make one attack with a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. 

**Mounted.** This weapon deals the damage listed in parenthesis when you are wielding it while mounted.

**Parrying.** When you are wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while [[Incapacitated]], [[Paralyzed]], [[Restrained]], or [[Stunned]].

**Parrying Immunity.** Attacks with this weapon ignore the parrying property and Armor Class bonuses from shields.

**Range.** This weapon fires ammunition. The range lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range.

**Reach.** This weapon can be used to make attacks against targets within 10 feet. If a weapon has a longer reach, it is stated in parentheses after this property.

**Simple.** This weapon can be used with very little skill or training, and all creatures gain proficiency with it.

**Thrown.** This weapon can be thrown as a ranged weapon attack. The thrown property lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal thrown range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range. Additionally, when using this weapon to make a ranged weapon attack, you may choose to use your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage roll.

**Trip.** When used with a combat manoeuvre that trips a creature or the Knockdown attack, this weapon add +1 to your roll. If the target is mounted, it adds +2.

**Two-Handed.** You must use two hands to wield this weapon.

**Versatile.** This weapon may be wielded with one or both hands. If wielded with both hands, it deals the damage listed in parentheses.

**Vicious.** A vicious weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17–20).

**Brace.** If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging creature.

**Monk.** A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows

**Disarm.** When you use a disarm weapon, you get a +2 bonus on Combat Maneuver Checks to disarm an enemy.

**Blocking.** When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC

**Double.** You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

**Distracting.** You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon.

**Performance.** When wielding this weapon, if an attack or combat maneuver made with this weapon prompts a combat performance check, you gain a +2 bonus on that check. *See Gladiator Weapons below for more information.*

**Deadly.** When you use this weapon to deliver a coup de grace, it gains a +4 bonus to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.

**Grapple.** On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can grapple the target of the attack. The wielder can then attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple his opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the target with a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the grapple. If you move far enough away to be out of the weapon’s reach, you end the grapple with that action.
