## Masterwork Weapons

A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) on [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll). You can’t add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the [Craft](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft) skill). The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).

Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) of the projectile weapon firing it.

All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) granted by the masterwork quality doesn’t stack with the [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) provided by the weapon’s magic.

Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can’t create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an [enhancement bonus](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Enhancement-Bonus) on [attack rolls](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll). Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.
