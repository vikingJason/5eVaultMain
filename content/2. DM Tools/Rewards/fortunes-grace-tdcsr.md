# Fortune's Grace
*Blessing*  

Your fate-touched essence can cause events to shift in your favor. When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can choose to reroll the `d20`. You must reroll the die before the outcome of the initial roll is determined.

Alternatively, when a creature you can see makes an attack against you or makes a saving throw against one of your spells or features, you can force that creature to reroll the attack roll or saving throw.

If the roll that triggers the reroll is made with advantage or disadvantage, both d20s are rerolled. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
