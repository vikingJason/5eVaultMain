# Karametra's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Karametra trait*

As a devotee of Karametra, you have proven yourself a worthy potential champion of the harvest god. As a bonus action, you can invoke her protection; spectral plants cover you, providing you with a +1 bonus to AC for 1 minute. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
