# Charm of Greater Conscription

While you have this charm, you attract flies. As an action, you activate this charm to summon a [horned devil](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/horned-devil.md). This devil appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, obeys your commands begrudgingly, and serves you under protest for 9 days or until it dies, whereupon it disappears. When the devil disappears, this charm vanishes from you.
