# Magical Enchanter
*Expansion*  

*Delicate strands of the arcane are woven together here, empowering simple items to become magical wonders.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 5,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Altar of blessings  

A creature with spell slots can use this room to make any magic item that is not a potion or artifact, in half the normal time, and with half the normal materials cost. If the item would be an enchanted mundane object (such as a +1 longsword, for example), the mundane object must be created first, and its value can be deducted from the cost of the enchantment (before dividing it in half with the magical enchanter).

In all other ways, use the existing rules ([Downtime Activity: Crafting a Magic Item](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-crafting-a-magic-item.md); [Downtime Activity: Crafting an Item](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-crafting-an-item-xge.md)) for crafting magic items.

Additionally, once each day a creature can use this room and 1 minute of effort to apply its choice of up to two of the effects available to the artificer's [Magical Tinkering](2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/artificer-tce.md#Magical%20Tinkering%20(Level%201)) feature (TCE, p. 11), to a tiny nonmagical object. Doing so does not require the use of tools, and in all ways other than those listed here, this functions identically to the rules of the Magical Tinkering feature.

A number of objects can be affected in this way equal to three times the structure's total room points, and affecting an object beyond this amount causes the first affected object to lose the effects it has been granted in this way
