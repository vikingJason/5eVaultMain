# Thassa's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Thassa trait*

As a devotee of Thassa, you have proven yourself a worthy representative of the god of the sea. You can cast [fog cloud](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fog-cloud.md) with this trait. Fog created in this way smells strongly of the sea. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
