# Portal Conflux
*Expansion*  

*The cobblestones laid into the floor of this chamber rattle with the ebb and flow of the arcane energy pouring through the wide portal mouths that encircle the room's perimeter. Through the surface of each, a visitor can view new lands, cities, and even alien worlds.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 15,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Requirements.** A structure with at least 3 total room points, a creature capable of casting 7th-level spells  

When you create this room, it contains a number of portals equal to half this structure's total room points (round up). Each of these portals follows the rules of the [gate](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/gate.md) spell, excepting that they allow for two-way travel, do not require spell slots or a materials cost, do not require concentration, cannot forcibly draw creatures through them, and have an indefinite duration. As with the gate spell, deities and other planar rulers can deny a portal's creation in their realm or presence.

These portals can only be destroyed with a casting of [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) at 7th-level or higher, or with the destruction of this room or the structure itself. If the room and structure still stand, a destroyed portal will be reformed after 30 days, leading to a location chosen by the owners of this structure.

This room can be built multiple times.
