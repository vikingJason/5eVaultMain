# Theater
*Expansion*  

*An enormous hall complete with seating, a large stage, and excellent acoustics. This room is well equipped for plays, concerts, and speeches, making them feel that much more true-to-life.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 10 gp (optional)  

Having a theater in a structure gives the owners of the structure a space to perform shows, or to allow shows to be performed by traveling musicians and acting troupes. Alternatively, the owners of this structure can hire an acting troupe to remain in residence. Regardless, any creature that spends a short rest in this room watching a performance gains a point of inspiration.

**Income.** When shows are put on by wandering musicians and actors, or the owners themselves, the theater generates an income of 176 gp (or 2d10 × 16 gp) every 30 days.

However, the maintenance cost can be paid in order to retain an acting troupe in residence, which hires 10 unskilled hirelings and 4 skilled hirelings proficient in [Deception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Performance](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Performance), or [Persuasion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion), or with the [disguise kit](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/disguise-kit.md), [carpenter's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/carpenters-tools.md), [painter's supplies](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/painters-supplies.md), or a [musical instrument](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/musical-instrument.md). When an acting troupe is in residence, the theater instead produces an income of 605 gp (or 2d10 × 55 gp) every 30 days.
