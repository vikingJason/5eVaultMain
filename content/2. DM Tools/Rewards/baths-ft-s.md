# Baths
*Expansion*  

*Steam rises and settles over a series of intricate, beautifully tiled pools. The trickling of water echoes throughout, and soft lights refract off lightly perfumed waves, creating a most relaxing atmosphere for those within.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Festhall, sauna, sweat lodge  

Creatures that take a short rest within this room gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the structure's total room points (maximum 30). These temporary hit points last until they are lost, or until the creature finishes a long rest.

While a creature has these temporary hit points, it has advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that would cause it to be [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) or [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed).
