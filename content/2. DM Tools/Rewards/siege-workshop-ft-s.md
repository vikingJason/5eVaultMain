# Siege Workshop
*Expansion*  

*A tidy, if eclectic, workshop full of all elements. The hiss of smelted iron mingles with the back-and-forth saw rhythm of precision woodcutting, as weapons of war are churned out for your structure's defense.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 5,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 8 gp  

A team of at least 3 skilled hirelings proficient in appropriate sets of tools and 10 unskilled hirelings (all paid for by the maintenance cost) can build and maintain siege equipment here. The workshop can build one of the following siege weapons at any one time, the statistics for all of which are found in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, page 255:
