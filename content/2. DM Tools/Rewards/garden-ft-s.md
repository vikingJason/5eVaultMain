# Garden
*Expansion*  

*The smell of green, growing life fills the air here. Lush vines laden with savory tomatoes grow alongside mandrake root, ephedra, and even more esoteric herbs.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 4 gp (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Druidic grove, greenhouse, poisoner's grotto  

Contains an assortment of herbs and grown vegetables.

This room can be built multiple times.

**Income.** Every 30 days, the garden grows an amount of herbs equal in worth to 225 gp (or 1d4 × 90 gp). A creature proficient in [Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature) or with the [herbalism kit](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md) can harvest these herbs with 8 hours of effort.

Once harvested, the herbs can be sold for their worth in currency, or used as materials to craft any item (within reason), mundane or magical, that could be created with [alchemist's supplies](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-supplies.md), [brewer's supplies](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/brewers-supplies.md), [cook's utensils](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/cooks-utensils.md), or the [poisoner's kit](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/poisoners-kit.md). Typically this would include any drinkable items, non-meat edible items, poisons, liquids, and magic items in the potion category, though your DM may rule that certain potions or poisons are unable to be brewed with herbs from the garden. Use the existing crafting rules ([Downtime Activity: Crafting](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-crafting.md); [Downtime Activity: Crafting a Magic Item](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-crafting-a-magic-item.md); [Downtime Activity: Crafting an Item](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-crafting-an-item-xge.md)) for this purpose.

If you pay the maintenance cost to hire a staff of two skilled hirelings either proficient in [Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature) or with the [herbalism kit](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md) to act as gardeners, the garden instead produces herbs worth 450 gp (or 2d4 × 90 gp) every 30 days.
