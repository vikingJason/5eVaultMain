# Docks, Air
*Expansion*  

*The wind whistles by the tall spindly silhouette of the docking tower, and the ballasts belonging to the anchored ships rustle against one another as the ships themselves creak and moan. The heavy, cold stone of the tower is as sure an anchor to a sky ship as a hunk of curved iron, and though the ships may sway, their mooring here remains safe.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 10,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Requirements.** Knowledge of air travel technology, a structure with at least 3 total room points.  

A number of airships equal to your structure's total room points can moor safely at this location, which is likely a spire or free-floating dock. Mechanical elevators and cranes are also present to raise and lower cargo. Roll once on the [Merchants](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/merchants-ft-s.md) in the "Traders and Merchants" section. This merchant is present for 30 days, after which they depart and a new randomly-rolled merchant arrives, continuing this pattern every 30 days.

**Income.** This room generates an income of 165 gp (or 2d10 Ã— 15 gp) every 30 days
