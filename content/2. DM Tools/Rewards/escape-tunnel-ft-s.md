# Escape Tunnel
*Expansion*  

*Deep beneath the earth, a tunnel lined in ancient masonry runs from your structure to some safe and innocuous point in the outside world. Should the worse come to pass, you at least have a way out.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Escape portal  

A secret tunnel runs from a point in your structure you choose to another point outside within a mile, also of your choosing. This room automatically benefits from the [Hidden](2-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/hidden-ft-s.md) improvement.
