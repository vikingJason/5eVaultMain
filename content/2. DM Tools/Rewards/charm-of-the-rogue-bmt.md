# Charm of the Rogue

You can cast [Mislead](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mislead.md), requiring no spell components and using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). When you cast the spell in this way, it lasts its full duration with no concentration required. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
