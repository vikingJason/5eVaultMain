# Iroas's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Iroas trait*

You can cast [crusader's mantle](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/crusaders-mantle.md) with this trait. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened).
