# Sewers
*Expansion*  

*Full of waste, refuse, and the occasional crocodile, the sewers do an excellent job keeping filth under the streets, rather than on top of them.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  

Creatures that dwell within a structure containing this room lead healthier lives and live in a much more sanitary environment. As such, the owners of this structure, their allies, and any other creatures that live in this structure have resistance to poison damage while within 5 miles of the structure, and while within this radius have advantage on all saving throws to resist becoming infected with disease or against spells or effects that would inflict the [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition.

Occasionally, strange items wash up in the sewers. Every 30 days, roll `1d6`. On a roll of 1 or 2, a random item from the [Trinket](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/trinket.md) (PHB, p. 160-161) is found, intact and (mostly) clean.
