# Nylea's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Nylea trait*

You can cast [speak with animals](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-animals.md) with this trait a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).
