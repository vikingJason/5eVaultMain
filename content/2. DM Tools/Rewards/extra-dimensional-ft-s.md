# Extra-Dimensional
*Modification*  

*The air inside the room seems somehow thicker, slightly more viscous. Outside shuttered windows, stars and comets cascade by, shining like a thousand diamonds against a swirling ethereal sky.*

- **Construction Cost.** 7,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Requirements.** A creature that can cast at least one 7th-level spell  

This room's door is actually a portal to a pocket dimension, containing the room itself. The laws of time and gravity in the expansion are yours to set, within limit, only once when you first modify the expansion. Gravity can be half to twice as strong, and time can move at halfpace to double time, relative to the outside.

The room also has the immunity to scrying, tracking, and similar effects that being located on a different plane provides, and is considered to be infinitely far away from the rest of its structure for the purposes of spells and effects (though not for the benefits the structure itself and its other expansions provide).
