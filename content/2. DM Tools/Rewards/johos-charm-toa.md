# Joho's Charm
*Charm*  

While you have Joho in your possession, it grants you the benefit of a [helm of comprehending languages](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/helm-of-comprehending-languages.md). This benefit lasts for 7 days while the doll is in your possession, after which the charm vanishes from you.

The doll is a Tiny construct. Destroying the doll causes the child's soul within it to become trapped in the Soulmonger.
