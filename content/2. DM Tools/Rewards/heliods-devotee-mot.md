# Heliod's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Heliod trait*

As a devotee of Heliod, you have proven yourself a worthy champion of the sun god. You can call on Heliod's favor and cast [bless](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bless.md) with this trait, requiring no material components. Heliod's blessing manifests as a nimbus around the affected creatures, causing them to shed dim light in a 5-foot radius until the spell ends. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
