# Animal Pen
*Expansion*  

*A large pen made to securely hold willing or unwilling beasts. A small nearby larder ensures food will not be in short supply, should the creature find itself hungry.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 or 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 or 5,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 or 30 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Aviary, barn, dragon trap, griffin roost, monster cage, petting zoo  

This room allows creatures to be held securely and safely, whether or not they desire to be, until you choose to release them. The creatures held here can be beasts, dragons, monstrosities, or other bestial creatures such as owlbears or displacer beasts.

This room can hold five creatures sized Small, three sized Medium, or one sized Large. If built using two room points, this capacity is doubled, and the pens can also instead house one Huge creature.

This room does not automatically include creatures, which must be acquired through other means. You can buy and construct this room multiple times
