# Charm of Many Tongues

You can speak and understand all languages, you gain proficiency in the [Deception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception) and [Persuasion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skills, and you can add double your normal proficiency bonus when using those skills. This charm vanishes from you when you die.
