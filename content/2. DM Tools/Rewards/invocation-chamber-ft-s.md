# Invocation Chamber
*Expansion*  

*The thrum of ancient and powerful eldritch magic permeates this room, its vibrations apparent to all that enter. At its heart sits an immense crystal the size of a man, glowing with an unearthly light, as visions and revelations stir just beneath its surface.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 5,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  

Once each day, a creature that possesses the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, has access to 5th level spell slots, and is either one of the owners of this structure or one of their allies, can use this room to invoke a powerful entity, beseeching it for aid or knowledge. That creature then casts either [contact other plane](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contact-other-plane.md) or [scrying](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) without expending a spell slot, even if the creature does not know the spell it has chosen. When cast in this way, the creature has advantage on the Intelligence saving throw required by contact other plane, and a creature targeted by the [scrying](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) spell has disadvantage on its Wisdom saving throw.

Once every 30 days, a creature that meets the above requirements and can cast at least one 6th level spell can cast the [planar ally](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/planar-ally.md) spell within this room, even if the creature does not know the spell, without expending spell slots or uses of class features. A planar ally conjured within this room cannot leave it for 8 hours without permission from the creature that summoned it, and is unable to attack or bring harm to its summoner while its summoner remains within this room.
