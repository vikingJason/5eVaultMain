# Charm of the Adamant

This charm has 9 charges. You can use an action to expend 1 charge from the charm to gain 30 temporary hit points. For the next hour, your eyes become voids of utter darkness, and you can't be [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened). Once all its charges have been expended, the charm vanishes from you.
