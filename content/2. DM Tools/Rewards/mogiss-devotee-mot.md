# Mogis's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Mogis trait*

As a devotee of Mogis, you have shown yourself to be a brutal combatant. You can call on Mogis's favor and cast [wrathful smite](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wrathful-smite.md) with this trait. Mogis's blessing manifest as a blood-red glow around your weapon, causing it to shed dim light in a 5-foot radius until the spell ends. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
