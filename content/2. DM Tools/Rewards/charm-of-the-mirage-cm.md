# Charm of the Mirage

> [!note]
> This charm can be bestowed by a [chwinga](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-cm.md) living a desert by using their Magical Gift action.

This charm allows you to cast the [hallucinatory terrain](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) spell (save DC 15) as an action. Once used, this charm vanishes from you.
