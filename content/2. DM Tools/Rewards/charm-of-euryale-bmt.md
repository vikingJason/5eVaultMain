# Charm of Euryale

As an action, you can unleash a petrifying wave of magic from your eyes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature has the [petrified](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, a creature is partially turned to stone and has the [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition. A [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this charm, it vanishes from you.
