# Docks, Water
*Expansion*  

*The waves lap lazily against wooden pilings and the bells of tall ships clang idly. The air is entwined with the briny smell of fresh fish and the loud conversation of burly dockworkers as travelers come and go from this port of call.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 10,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Requirements.** Structure must be adjacent to water  

A number of ships equal to twice your structure's total room points may lay anchor safely at this room, which is likely a harbor or waterfront. Roll twice on the [Merchants](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/merchants-ft-s.md) in the "Traders and Merchants" section. These merchants are present for 30 days, after which they depart and two new randomly-rolled merchants arrive, continuing this pattern every 30 days.

**Income.** This room generates an income of 275 gp (or 2d10 Ã— 25 gp) every 30 days
