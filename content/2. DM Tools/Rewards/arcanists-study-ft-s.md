# Arcanist's Study
*Expansion*  

*Nothing in the multiverse is stranger or more dangerous than the study of a dyed-in-the-wool magic user. Oddities adorn every murky wooden shelf, from a relatively-usual human skull to a planar vortex in a jar or a preening pseudodragon atop a bookcase. The air reeks of spell components, and books of specific lore cover seemingly every surface.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Binding circle, ritual circle, mirror maze  

Spells of any school with the ritual tag can be cast as rituals in half the usual time here without expending any components that do not have an associated cost in gold. If a ritual has components with a gold cost, this cost is halved when the ritual is performed in this room. While here, the owners of this structure and their allies have advantage on all rolls required by rituals.

Additionally, choose two schools of magic. While present within this room, spells in a chosen school cast by the owners of this structure and their allies have twice their normal duration, and half their normal materials cost (for materials with a gold cost). [Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) checks made here that deal with a chosen school of magic have advantage.

This room can be built multiple times, and each time different schools must be chosen
