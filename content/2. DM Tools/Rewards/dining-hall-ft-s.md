# Dining Hall
*Expansion*  

*A large room complete with long tables, chairs, and adjacent kitchen, lit by ornate candelabras and chandeliers. The smell of well-cooked meals long passed lingers on in this place, welcoming guests and residents with the promise of a full, satisfied belly.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 5,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 7 gp  
- **Can Also Be.** Ball room, mess hall  

This room must be staffed by at least 5 unskilled hirelings and 3 skilled hirelings proficient with [cook's utensils](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/cooks-utensils.md) to be functional, paid for by the maintenance cost. Once every 30 days, the owners of this structure can decide to hold a lavish banquet in this room. This banquet takes 1 hour to prepare, and 1 hour to consume.

The effects of this lavish banquet are identical to the effects of the [heroes' feast](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heroes-feast.md) spell, save that it is able to feed twice as many creatures. Creatures only gain these benefits if they eat the food at the banquet itself, and this food loses its potency after 24 hours.

Mundane banquets can also be held in this room. If the owners of this structure decide to hold a mundane banquet, it takes 1 hour to prepare, and creates enough food to feed up to 100 creatures.
