# Selesnya Charm
*Charm*  

When you activate this charm, you can cast the [aura of vitality](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/aura-of-vitality.md) or [conjure animals](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/conjure-animals.md) spell. Alternatively, as an action, you can give up to three creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the end of your next turn. The charm vanishes after you activate it.
