# Dark Gift of Yrrga, the Eye of Shadows
*Charm*  

Yrrga's gift is the power of true seeing. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the benefits of [truesight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#truesight) out to a range of 60 feet. These benefits last for 30 days, after which the dark gift vanishes.

The eyes of the beneficiary become starry voids until the dark gift vanishes. The beneficiary of this dark gift also gains the following flaw: "I believe that all life is pointless and look forward to death when it finally comes."
