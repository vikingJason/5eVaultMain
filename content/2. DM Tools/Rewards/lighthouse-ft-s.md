# Lighthouse
*Expansion*  

*A burning light that shines out like a brilliant star along the coastline, a lighthouse is a welcome sight for mariners and travelers well-versed in the perils of the sea.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp (optional)  
- **Requirements.** Structure must be adjacent to water  
- **Can Also Be.** Beacon  

Ships traveling on water that are allied with the owners of this structure and are within a distance of this structure equal to 2 days of normal travel are able to navigate more accurately with the presence of a lighthouse. Within this distance, these ships can double their travel pace while not in combat without worrying about the dangers the sea presents.

If the maintenance cost is paid to hire a skilled hireling proficient with [navigator's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/navigators-tools.md) or [vehicles (water)](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/mounts-and-vehicles-waterborne-vehicles.md) as a lighthouse keeper, the crews of any ships friendly to the owners of this structure have advantage on checks required by Activities While Traveling or Hazards while they can see this lighthouse.
