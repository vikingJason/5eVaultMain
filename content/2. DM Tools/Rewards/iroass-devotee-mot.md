# Iroas's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Iroas trait*

As a devotee of Iroas, you have earned his favor through victories won in his name. You can cast [compelled duel](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/compelled-duel.md) with this trait a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
