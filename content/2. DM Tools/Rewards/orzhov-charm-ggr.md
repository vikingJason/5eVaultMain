# Orzhov Charm
*Charm*  

When you activate this charm, you can cast the [bestow curse](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bestow-curse.md) or [fear](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear.md) spell. Alternatively, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to have it drop to 1 hit point instead. The charm vanishes after you activate it.
