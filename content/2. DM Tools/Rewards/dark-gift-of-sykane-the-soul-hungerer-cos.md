# Dark Gift of Sykane, the Soul Hungerer
*Charm*  

Sykane's gift is the power to raise the recently deceased. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [raise dead](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/raise-dead.md) spell as an action. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes.

As soon as this dark gift is received, the beneficiary's eyes glow a sickly yellow until the dark gift vanishes. The beneficiary also gains the following flaw: "If I help someone, I expect payment in return."
