# Dark Gift of Delban, the Star of Ice and Hate
*Charm*  

Delban's gift is the power to unleash deadly cold. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [cone of cold](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/cone-of-cold.md) spell as an action. After it has been used seven times, the dark gift vanishes. Until it vanishes, the beneficiary also gains the benefits of a [ring of warmth](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-warmth.md).

The beneficiary of this dark gift gains the following flaw: "Fire terrifies me."
