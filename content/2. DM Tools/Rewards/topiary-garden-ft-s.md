# Topiary Garden
*Expansion*  

*The wind whistles through this verdant garden, rustling the leaves in the large shaped hedges that make up this place. Though it is peaceful, those that enter here can't help but shake the feeling that they are being watched.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Requirements.** A structure with at least 3 total room points  

This room is populated with a number of [awakened shrubs](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-shrub.md) (MM, p. 317) equal to five times your structure's total room points, each one counting as an unpaid, unskilled hireling for any structure or room requirements. Each shrub that fills a position that would otherwise belong to an unskilled hireling reduces the structure's Total Cost per Day by 2 sp.

The shrubs do as commanded by the owners of the structure and their allies, and stand motionless in place if commands conflict, waiting until new commands are given. These shrubs can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. If a shrub leaves the structure it was created in for more than 7 consecutive days, it roots in place, becoming a mundane un-awakened shrub.

Additionally, these shrubs can be ordered to combine, forming larger topiary creatures more capable of combat. Five shrubs can combine into a single entity, which uses the statistics of an [awakened tree](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/awakened-tree.md) (MM, p. 317), and follows any orders from the owners of this structure and their allies. If this awakened tree is reduced to 0 hit points and dies, so do all the shrubs that make up its body. This tree can be ordered to split apart at any time by the owners of this structure or one of their allies. If it does and is missing hit points, one of the shrubs that makes up the tree dies for every 12 hit points the tree is missing.

While formed into a tree, the constituent shrubs are no longer able to replace hirelings within the structure. Shrubs can also be ordered to form a tree and attack automatically when they see unknown intruders, or specific creatures or types of creatures designated by the owners of this structure or their allies.

Any dead shrubs regrow after 30 days, up to the maximum initially present when this room was first constructed.
