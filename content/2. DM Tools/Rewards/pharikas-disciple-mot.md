# Pharika's Disciple
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 25+ Pharika trait*

Pharika blesses you with Pharika's Balm, an effect that can cure or enfeeble. As an action, you can touch a creature and choose one of the following:

- The target regains hit points equal to `1d8` + your Wisdom modifier, and you can cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it.  
- The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target deals only half damage with weapon attacks. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.  

You can use this action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
