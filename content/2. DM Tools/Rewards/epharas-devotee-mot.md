# Ephara's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Ephara trait*

Ephara grants you insight into how people communicate. You can cast [comprehend languages](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/comprehend-languages.md) with this trait, requiring no material component, a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
