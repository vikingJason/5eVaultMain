# Fragment of Attachment
*Fragment of Suffering*  

## Benefit

You can't be [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) while within 10 feet of an ally. If you're already [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) and move within 10 feet of an ally, the [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition ends on you.

## Drawback

You have disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws while you aren't within 10 feet of an ally.
