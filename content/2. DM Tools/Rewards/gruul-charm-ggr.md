# Gruul Charm
*Charm*  

When you activate this charm, you can cast the [heroism](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heroism.md) or [thunderwave](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thunderwave.md) spell (3rd-level versions). Alternatively, as a reaction when you miss with a weapon attack, you can make another attack against the target you missed. The charm vanishes after you activate it.
