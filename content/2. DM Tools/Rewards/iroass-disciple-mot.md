# Iroas's Disciple
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 25+ Iroas trait*

As a bonus action, you can call on Iroas's blessing, gaining the following benefit for 1 minute or until you are [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated): creatures within 30 feet of you can't gain advantage on attack rolls against you. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
