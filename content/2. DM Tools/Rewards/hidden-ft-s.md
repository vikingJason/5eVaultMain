# Hidden
*Modification*  

*There's no telling what secrets a cleverly-designed structure might hide. Behind tapestries, false book-cases, or hidden switches lurk chambers tucked away where none may find them, save those that know the secret to accessing them.*

- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  

This modification is added onto any room to hide it from view. The owners of the structure and any allies they designate know the secret to enter the hidden room.

Another creature attempting to enter the room must first make an Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discover the presence of a hidden chamber, followed by a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check to uncover how to enter, once they are aware of its presence. The DC of both of these checks is equal to 10 + half the structure's total room points (round up).
