# Trapped
*Modification*  

*This room hides a deadly secret, and only you know where it might be found.*

- **Construction Cost.** Varies (see below)  
- **Construction Time.** Varies (see below)  
- **Requirements.** Varies (see below; none if none are listed)  

This room contains one of the following traps listed on the [Trap Construction](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/trap-construction-ft-s.md) table, which you choose when you build this modification. This modification can be built multiple times in a single room for multiple traps, and the same trap can be selected multiple times. Each time you build this room, work with your DM to determine an appropriate location for the trap, which can change its overall effectiveness.
