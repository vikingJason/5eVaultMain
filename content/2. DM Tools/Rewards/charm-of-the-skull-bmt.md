# Charm of the Skull

As a bonus action, you can transform into a deathly apparition. Your game statistics are replaced by those of a [wraith](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wraith.md), except for your alignment and personality; your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; and your passive Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score and languages. You don't have the wraith's Create Specter ability. Your equipment vanishes when you transform but returns when the transformation ends. The transformation lasts for 1 minute, until your wraith form is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you use a bonus action to end it. If the wraith form is reduced to 0 hit points and there is still damage left over, the remaining damage applies to your normal hit points. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
