# Maze
*Expansion*  

*The high walls of this place arc up nearly out of sight, threatening to blot out the sun and sky. Creatures that find themselves wandering these labyrinthine corridors often feel a sense of hopelessness and impending doom, though whether this is enchantment or a product of the architecture itself, none can say.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 5,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Requirements.** A structure with at least 3 total room points  

When you create this room, it replaces the entrance to your structure with an elaborate maze which creatures without a flying speed must make their way through in order to enter your structure. You can choose to include a hidden passage that bypasses the maze at no additional cost, which follows the rules for the [Secret Passage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/secret-passage-ft-s.md) room modification (detailed in a later section). The maze cannot be the subject of any other room modifications.

Creatures attempting to navigate the maze must make a number of successful Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) or Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks (their choice) equal to half the structure's total room points (round up), the DC of which is equal to 10 + half the structure's total room points (round up). Each of these checks takes 1 hour to complete, whether or not it is successful.

If creatures are traveling through the maze as a group, one member of their group can make a single check for all the creatures in the group, gaining advantage if it is aided by the [Help](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Help) action from another one of these creatures with proficiency in a relevant skill. The owners of this structure, their allies, creatures familiar with the maze, or any creature with a climb speed can make these checks with advantage.

If a creature succeeds on these checks, it finds itself at the entrance of the structure. If a creature fails 3 of these checks in a row, it becomes lost, resetting its number of successful checks to 0.

Each 10 foot segment of the walls of this maze has an AC of 17; 27 hit points; a height of 40 feet, and immunity to all damage except bludgeoning, slashing, acid, fire, force, thunder, necrotic, and damage from a pick. The walls ignore any damage done to them from any source that does not instantly reduce them to 0 hit points or below with a single damage roll.

In place of a check to navigate the maze, a creature can choose to attempt to damage the maze's walls, using its [Attack](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack) action or a spell to attempt to inflict the necessary damage. Successfully destroying a section of walls counts as a successful check, while failing to destroy a section of wall counts as a failed check. Destroyed walls magically repair themselves after 30 days.

If this structure also contains an [Animal Pens](2-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/animal-pen-ft-s.md) or [Jails](2-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/jails-ft-s.md) room, the captive creatures contained within them can be released into the maze. While these captive creatures are within the maze, both the Animal Pens and Jails still count as if they were occupied, and the captive creatures are unable to escape the maze. If any creatures attempting to navigate the maze fail two checks in a row, they encounter the captive creatures, which could result in combat depending on the inclinations of the creatures involved.
