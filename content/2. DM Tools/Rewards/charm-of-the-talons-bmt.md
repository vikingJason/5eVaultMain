# Charm of the Talons

As an action, you can cast [Dispel Magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md), requiring no spell components and using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). If you successfully end any spells with it, you gain `1d6` "temporary hit points" for each spell level of the highest-level spell ended. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
