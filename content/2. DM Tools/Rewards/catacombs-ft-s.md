# Catacombs
*Expansion*  

*Deep, dark, and dreary, this sodden collection of stone cellars and hidden pathways holds many forgotten secrets.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Bone pile, crypt, tombs  

Dead bodies can be interred here, and suffer no degradation for the purposes of necromancy spells. When this room is first built, it comes with five skeletal servants, each one counting as an unpaid, unskilled hireling for any structure or room requirements. Each skeleton that fills a position that would otherwise belong to an unskilled hireling reduces the structure's Total Cost per Day by 2 sp.

These skeleton servants have an AC of 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 8, are undead instead of humanoid, cannot speak, and cannot attack (unless equipped by the [Armory](2-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/armory-ft-s.md) and doing so in defense of your structure).

The servants do as commanded by the owners of the structure and their allies, and stand motionless in place if commands conflict, waiting until new commands are given. These skeletal servants can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. If a skeletal servant leaves the structure it was created in for more than 7 consecutive days, it disintegrates into dust.

Every 30 days on the advent of a full moon (or other celestial event of equal significance), a 1 hour ritual can be performed by any character or hireling that can cast at least one necromancy spell. When the ritual is complete, it raises an additional five skeletal servants (if there are an adequate number of dead Medium or Small humanoid bodies entombed in this room) that join the others in the service of your structure.

A structure can have a maximum number of functioning skeletal servants equal to 20 Ã— the structure's total room points.
