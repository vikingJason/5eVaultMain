# Caravansary
*Expansion*  

*A small roadside house for travelers, filled with the smells of cooked food and pack animals. Outside, visiting merchants bark their wares, enticing locals with colorful goods from distant lands.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room points  
- **Construction Cost.**  2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  

Roll four times on the [Merchants](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/merchants-ft-s.md) table in the "Traders and Merchants" section. These merchants are present at this location for 30 days, after which they depart and four new randomly-rolled merchants arrive, continuing this pattern every 30 days.

This room can be built multiple times.

**Income.** If your structure is located in an area that can reasonably expect trade, this room generates an income of 220 gp (or 2d10 x 20 gp) every 30 days.
