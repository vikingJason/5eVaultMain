# Purphoros's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Purphoros trait*

You can cast [heat metal](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heat-metal.md) with this trait, requiring no material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
