# Stables
*Expansion*  

*The sounds and smells of horses and strangers animals still animate thee cold stone stables. Straw matting, water, and feed are available, providing mounts the shelter and relative comfort they need to properly recuperate.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 3 gp (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Carriage house, coach house, wheelhouse  

Your structure gains the ability to house and support horses or other Large or Medium beasts trained to be used as mounts, and can hold four of these creatures for each unit of your structure's maximum room points. Mounts that receive a long rest within this room have their movement speed increased by 10 feet until their next long rest. This stable does not come equipped with mounts, and mounts must be acquired by other means.

If the maintenance cost is paid in order to hire a skilled hireling proficient in [Animal Handling](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling) to act as a stable master, as well as 5 unskilled hirelings to act as stablehands, this structure is considered to be the permanent home of a vehicles and transportation merchant. The quality of this merchant's goods changes every 30 days, but it can never be less than poor, and is rerolled if it would ever be lower than this quality. If you are using the Traders and Merchants ^[book/Walrock Homebrew; Traders and Merchants.json] supplement, this merchant does not have access to any water or air transportation options.

**Income.** Additionally, if the maintenance cost is paid, this room generates an income of 225 gp (or 2d8 Ã— 25 gp) every 30 days.
