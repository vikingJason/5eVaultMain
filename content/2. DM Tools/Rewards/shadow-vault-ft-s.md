# Shadow Vault
*Expansion*  

*Not all things were meant for all eyes. This room contains a complex working of arcane runes and foci, humming with a distant power, that project a constant illusion hiding your structure from view*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  

The area around your structure, out to a radius of 300 feet beyond your structure's walls, is affected by a special [hallucinatory terrain](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) spell, the details of which you determine when you first build this room. This spell is also able to change the appearance of manufactured structures within its area, but not creatures or equipment. Thus, a tower could appear to be an enormous tree, a cottage could be a boulder, or a college could be blanketed in an endless fog.

At any time, the owners of this structure or a friendly creature that they designate can change the nature of this illusion by entering the room and using an action to do so, determining whatever new attributes of the illusion apply. The illusion can be temporarily disabled with such an action, as well, or re-enabled with a similar action at a later time.
