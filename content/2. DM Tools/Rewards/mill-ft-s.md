# Mill
*Expansion*  

*The grinding and churning of the mill beats a constant tempo of progress and production. A mill is the heart of civilization, carrying lifeblood to all its other aspects.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Requirements.** One raw resource (wood, metal, grain, fish, wool, gems, or similar) harvested and under the control of the owner of this structure or their allies, within 5 miles of the structure.  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 5 gp  
- **Can Also Be.** Cannery, loom, lumber mill, mint, water wheel, windmill  

A room for the refinement of resources, in whatever form that might take. This room can be built multiple times

**Income.** If this room is fully staffed by at least 5 unskilled hirelings and at least 2 skilled hirelings proficient in a relevant set of artisan's tools (paid for by the maintenance cost), it can produce refined materials from available raw resources.

If these raw resources are supplied, the mill can generate salable materials worth 550 gp (or 1d10 Ã— 100 gp) every 30 days. These materials can be sold to interested buyers, consumed in place of hirelings' wages if they are food (thus reducing your structure's Total Cost per Day), or used in place of gold cost for crafting, if applicable.
