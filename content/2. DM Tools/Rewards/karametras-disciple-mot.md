# Karametra's Disciple
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 25+ Karametra trait*

By performing an hour-long ritual, you can conjure enough grapes to fill three vials (4 ounces each) of wine. Each vial serves as a [potion of healing](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing.md) for 24 hours, after which it loses this property. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
