# Graveyard
*Expansion*  

*Rows of rough-hewn gravestones rise from the ground like jagged teeth, punctuated with the occasional stately monument denoting the death of someone of station. It is quiet here, but the silent air runs thick with the dark energy of death.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Mausoleum, necromancer's laboratory  

Dead bodies can be interred here, and suffer no degradation for the purposes of resurrection or necromancy spells. Additionally, there are considered to be an unlimited number of corpses for the purposes of necromancy here. When cast in this room by the owners of this structure or their allies, the spells [animate dead](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animate-dead.md) and [create undead](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-undead.md) each create an additional undead creature of the lowest possible CR.

Additionally, [Arcana](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion) checks made here that deal with necromancy or the dead have advantage.
