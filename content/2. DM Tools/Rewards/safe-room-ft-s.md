# Safe Room
*Expansion*  

*Tucked between the walls of this structure, this room appears on no maps. While its very existence appears forgotten, it contains everything necessary to shelter a number of creatures from harm indefinitely*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Requirements.** A structure with at least 3 total room points  

Away from sight in an obscure corner of the structure, this room is a shelter that the owners of this structure and their allies can escape to in times of need. When you build this room, it automatically benefits from the [Hidden](2-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/hidden-ft-s.md) room modification (detailed later) with no additional cost.

This room is constructed from walls made of mithral with an AC of 21; 40 hit points; immunity to all damage except acid, fire, force, and necrotic; and that ignore any damage done to them from any one source that would not instantly reduce them to 0 hit points or below.

Entering this room, even via a secret passage, places you outside these mithral walls, which must be broken down or opened with a command word (known to the owners of the structure) to themselves be entered.

All the amenities of life are contained within these mithral walls, allowing up to 4 creatures a limitless supply of pure water, preserved food, and clean air, along with bedding, waste disposal, and supplies to live a modest lifestyle without any cost.

More creatures can be housed inside the safe room, but the lifestyle quality decreases with more creatures sheltered within the room. This room can support up to 6 creatures with a poor lifestyle, 8 creatures with a squalid lifestyle, or 10 creatures with a wretched lifestyle. The room does not contain enough food, water, or air to support more than 10 creatures, and attempting to shelter more than 10 creatures within the room subjects each creature in the room to a level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) for each day it spends within the room.
