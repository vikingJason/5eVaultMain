# Charm of Bounty

> [!note]
> This charm can be bestowed by a [chwinga](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-toa.md) living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions by using their Magical Gift action.

This charm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to cast the [create food and water](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/create-food-and-water.md) spell, requiring no components. Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.
