# Docks, Planar
*Expansion*  

*A rippling hole in the fabric of space and time is enough to send shivers down the spine of even the most experienced wizard. Yet, here one exists, stable and large enough for one of several exotic and otherworldly skiffs and ships to make their way through.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 15,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Requirements.** Knowledge of planar travel technology, a structure with at least 3 total room points.  

A number of spelljammers or similar dimensional ships equal to your structure's total room points can moor safely at this location, which is likely an immense hangar or free-floating dock built into a stable portal to another realm. Roll once on the [Merchants](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/merchants-ft-s.md) table in the "Traders and Merchants" section. This merchant is present for 30 days, after which they depart and a newly rolled merchant arrives, continuing this pattern every 30 days.

**Income.** This room generates an income of 180 gp (or 2d8 Ã— 20 gp) in strange currency (such as electrum or fragments of astral diamonds) every 30 days
