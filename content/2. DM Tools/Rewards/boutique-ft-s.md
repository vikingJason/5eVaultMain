- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp

When you first build this room, choose one merchant from the [Merchants](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/merchants-ft-s.md) table in the "Traders and Merchants" section. This merchant is in permanent residence at your structure, though the quality of their goods changes every 30 days. If the merchant's goods are of a quality less than medium, you may reroll any number of times until you receive a result of medium or greater quality.

You can change the merchant in residence here at a later time by paying 1,000 gp to renovate the boutique. This process leaves the boutique unavailable for 30 days, after which a new merchant is selected, as they were when this room was first created.

This room can be built multiple times.

Income. If your structure is located in an area that can reasonably expect trade, this room generates an income of 225 gp (or 3d4 Ã— 30 gp) every 30 days.
