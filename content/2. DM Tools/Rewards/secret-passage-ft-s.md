# Secret Passage
*Modification*  

*An airy draft billows behind the walls of this room, traveling unseen from one room to the next. An astute few know the secret to accessing this passage, which remains hidden to all but the most observant.*

- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Requirements.** At least two completed room expansions, a structure with at least 3 total room points  

This modification is built in two rooms simultaneously, though it only requires one construction cost to be paid. A secret passage makes a hidden connection between these two rooms, behind walls, under floors, and generally out of view.

Similar to a hidden room, the owners of the structure and any allies they designate know how to enter this secret passage from either of its entrances, and can move freely between these two rooms. All others must first make an Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discover the presence of a secret passage, followed by a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check to uncover how to enter, once they are aware of it. The DC of both of these checks is equal to 10 + half the structure's total room points (round up).

You can built multiple secret passages into one room, but each passage must connect to a different room.
