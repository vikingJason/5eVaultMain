# Charm of the Comet

As an action, you can force a creature you can see within 60 feet of you to focus on you. For 1 minute, creatures other than you and the target are [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) to the target. The effect ends if any creature other than you damages the target or forces the target to make a saving throw. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
