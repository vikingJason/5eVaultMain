# Charm of Hellish Rebuke

A fiery halo appears above your head when you receive this charm. This charm allows you to cast the [hellish rebuke](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hellish-rebuke.md) spell (9th-level version) as a reaction. Once used nine times, the charm vanishes from you, as does the fiery halo.
