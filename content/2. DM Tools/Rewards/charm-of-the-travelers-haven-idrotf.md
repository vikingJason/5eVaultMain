# Charm of the Traveler's Haven

> [!note]
> This charm can be bestowed by a [chwinga](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-toa.md) living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions by using their Magical Gift action.

This charm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to cast the [Leomund's tiny hut](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md) spell, no components required. Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.
