# Charm of Instant Tools

> [!note]
> This charm can be bestowed by a [chwinga astronaut](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-astronaut-bam.md) using their Magical Gift action.

This charm allows you to magically conjure a set of artisan's tools, navigator's tools, or thieves' tools. The conjured tools appear either in your hand or somewhere else in your space (your choice). Once used, this charm goes away, but the tools remain.
