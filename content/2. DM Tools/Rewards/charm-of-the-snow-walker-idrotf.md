# Charm of the Snow Walker

> [!note]
> This charm can be bestowed by a [chwinga](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-toa.md) living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions by using their Magical Gift action.

This charm has 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to gain the following benefits for 24 hours:

- You and your allies within 15 feet of you ignore difficult terrain caused by snow or ice.  
- You can see through areas heavily obscured by snow to a distance of 60 feet.  
- You are immune to the effects of extreme cold, as described in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" (though you gain no protection from cold damage).  

Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.
