# Curse of Ruin

Countless legends invoke *hgar'Gruum*, the Curse of Ruin. Great orc warriors have been laid low when bloodlust overtook their reason. Mighty mages driven by a foolhardy ambition forsook caution and delved furiously into knowledge no mortal eyes should behold. The Curse of Ruin is said to be the birthright of all "orcs"—a deadly taint carried in the blood of the Ruiner that forged their people during the "Calamity".

## Truth of Ruin

The truth is that the Curse of Ruin is a myth. The blood of the Ruiner granted "orcs" physical strength and superhuman endurance, but it imparted none of the Betrayer God's evil. The power of the myth, however, is more ruinous than any magic.

## Consequences of the Myth

Countless superstitious folk across Exandria—including many "orcs" themselves—believe in the Curse of Ruin. This belief doesn't make the curse any more real. The myth's existence is a convenient way for any one orc to ignore the real consequences of their mistakes, or of any act of thoughtless harm—the curse takes the blame. Even worse is when this "birthright" is leveled at wise, even-tempered "orcs" who have done nothing wrong, and their frustrated reactions are then taken as proof of the curse's existence.
