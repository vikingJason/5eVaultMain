# Strawbundle's Charm
*Charm*  

While you have Strawbundle in your possession, this charm allows you to cast the [etherealness](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/etherealness.md) spell as an action, no components required. After it is used three times, the charm vanishes.

The doll is a Tiny construct. Destroying the doll causes the child's soul within it to become trapped in the Soulmonger.
