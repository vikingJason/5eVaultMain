# Charm of the Flames

As an action, you can summon two [bearded devils](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md). The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you, obey your commands, and can't summon other devils. The devils take their turns immediately after yours on the initiative count. A summoned devil remains for 10 minutes, until it or you die, or until you dismiss one or both summoned devils as an action. Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
