# Chapel
*Expansion*  

*A small chapel containing religious imagery, seating, iconography, and proper accoutrement, alongside a modest library of holy texts and literature. The air hums with the resonance of hymns, and the comforting soul of the divine.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Dark altar, spirit lodge  

The structure this room is in is affected by a version of the [hallow](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallow.md) spell with a permanent duration, the details of which are decided upon when the construction of this room is completed. The [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell can end this effect only if cast as an 7th-level spell or higher. If the room and structure still stand, the structure will again be affected by [hallow](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallow.md) after 30 days, its details again decided by the owners of the structure.

The [hallow](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallow.md) spell can be cast within this room, and if it is, it instead changes the effects of the hallow spell on the entire structure. [Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion) checks made here that deal with the lore surrounding the deity, philosophy, or religion the chapel is associated with have advantage.

**Income.**  If the maintenance cost for this room is paid in order to staff the room with a skilled hireling proficient in [religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#religion), parishioners will visit this room and provide tithes. In which case, this room will generate an income from those tithes of 140 gp (or 4d6 Ã— 10 gp) every 30 days.
