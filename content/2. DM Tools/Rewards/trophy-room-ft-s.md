# Trophy Room
*Expansion*  

*This collection of tokens taken from past triumphs is certainly impressive, if a little grisly. The decor of this room treads the fine line between awe-inspiring and terrifying.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Museum  

The trophies or objects in this room are centered around a specific type of creature other than humanoids (such as beasts or fiends), or one race of humanoids (such as elves or halflings). After a creature takes a short rest in this room, it gains the following benefits concerning the type of creature or race of humanoids the room is centered on:

- Advantage on [Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival) checks made to track these creatures.  
- Advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks made concerning these creatures.  
- Advantage on initiative checks when it can see at least one of these creatures, and that creature is hostile.  
- Deals an additional `1d4` damage on attacks it makes against these creatures.  

These benefits last until the creature finishes a long rest.
