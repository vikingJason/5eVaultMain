# Warded or Spell-bound
*Modification*  

*The magical energy of a persistent spell suffuses this room, protecting it or providing some less obvious, more obscure benefit.*

- **Construction Cost.** Varies (see below)  
- **Construction Time.** 7 days  
- **Requirements.** A creature that can cast the listed spell.  

This room is constantly under the effect of one of the following spells, the details of which you decide when you build this modification and which can only be altered later by rebuilding this modification in the same room and paying the cost a second time.

The spell is considered to have a duration of permanent, and can be dispelled with a casting of [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) of 7th-level or greater. If a spell is dispelled in this way, it reasserts itself after 30 days.

These spells are always considered to fill the entire room and are cast at their lowest level possible, with the owners of the structure and those they designate considered to be the spell's casters. Saves made against spells cast with this modification are made against a DC of 10 + half the structure's total room points (round up).

You can build this modification in a single room multiple times, choosing a different spell for each time you construct it.
