# Shrine
*Expansion*  

*A humble construction, but nevertheless quite holy. It is laden with icons, censers, and a simple offering bowl waiting for the gifts of the faithful.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Profane idol, spirit totem  

A creature visiting this shrine can present it with a nonmagical object as an offering, which is then placed in a position of import and destroyed, usually by supernaturally powerful fire. The creature then gains a blessing, based on the monetary worth of the destroyed object, as detailed on the table below. A creature can only gain one such blessing every 24 hours.

**Shrine Blessings**

| Object Worth | Blessing |
|--------------|----------|
| 5 gp or less | Targeted by a casting of [guidance](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance.md) with a duration of 24 hours. |
| 6-10 gp | As above, except the `d4` can also be applied to an attack or saving throw, instead of an ability check. |
| 10-25 gp | As above, except the spell grants a total of `2d4`, each die of which must be applied to a separate roll. After the last `d4` is applied, the spell ends. |
| 26-50 gp | As above, except any amount of `d4`s can be applied to the same roll. |
| 51-100 gp | As above, except the spell grants a total of `3d4` instead of `2d4`. |
| 101-200 gp | As above, except the spell grants a total of `3d6` instead of `3d4`. |
| 201-400 gp | As above, except the spell grants a total of `3d8` instead of `3d6`. |
| 401-700 gp | As above, except the spell grants a total of `3d10` instead of `3d8`. |
| 701-1,000 gp | As above, except the spell grants a total of `3d12` instead of `3d10`. |
| 1,001+ gp | As above, except any attack that hits while its roll benefited from at least one of these dice becomes a critical hit. |
