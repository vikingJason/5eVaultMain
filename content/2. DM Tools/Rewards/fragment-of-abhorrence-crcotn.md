# Fragment of Abhorrence
*Fragment of Suffering*  

## Benefit

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack roll, you can force the target to move up to 10 feet away from you in a direction of your choice. A creature that can't be [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) is immune to this effect.

## Drawback

If you start your turn [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened), you take `2d6` psychic damage.
