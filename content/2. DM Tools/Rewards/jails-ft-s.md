# Jails
*Expansion*  

*Dark, and pungent prison cells, laden with rust and grime, greet unwelcome or belligerent guests. Hopefully, some time in uncomfortable conditions will show them the error of their ways.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Prison, sacrifice pit, torture chamber  

You have cells available to securely hold a number of humanoids up to five times your structure's total room points. Prisoners may only escape if they are unguarded, and either have access to this room's key (five of which come with this room), or by using [thieves' tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md) to make four successful DC 15 Dexterity checks. This room can be built multiple times.

This room is equipped for non-magical humanoids, and will not thwart magical attempts at escape unless the appropriate wards under the [Warded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rewards/warded-or-spell-bound-ft-s.md) improvement are purchased for this room.

If the maintenance cost for this room is paid in order to staff the room with a skilled hireling proficient in [Intimidation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) who acts as a warden, every 7 days you can choose for a single creature imprisoned within the jails for that entire duration to make a Charisma or Wisdom saving throw (its choice) against a DC of 15. On a failure, that creature truthfully answers up to `1d4` questions the hireling asks it, as long as the creature and the hireling share at least one language.
