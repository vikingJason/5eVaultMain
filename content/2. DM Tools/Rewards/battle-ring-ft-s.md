# Battle Ring
*Expansion*  

*A dusty ring of honor stands, lined with racks of weapons, as a test of mettle for those who enter Win or lose, sparring teaches everyone a little something.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Arena  

A creature that spends a short rest sparring or training here becomes conditioned for battle, which lasts until its next long rest. When a creature that is conditioned for battle rolls initiative, it has advantage on the roll, and on the first attack roll it makes on its first turn in combat
