# Blessing of Lonely Genius

Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

## Consequence

The character's intellect rubs old friends the wrong way. Three NPCs of the DM's choice become indifferent or hostile toward the character, and the character automatically fails any Charisma check made to improve their attitudes.
