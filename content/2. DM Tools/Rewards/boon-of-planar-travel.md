# Boon of Planar Travel

When you gain this boon, choose a plane of existence other than the Material Plane. You can now use an action to cast the [plane shift](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/plane-shift.md) spell (no spell slot or components required), targeting yourself only, and travel to the chosen plane, or from that plane back to the Material Plane. Once you use this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.
