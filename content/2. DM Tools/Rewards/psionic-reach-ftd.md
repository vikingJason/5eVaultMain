# Psionic Reach
*Draconic Gift, VERY_RARE*  

The psionic energy of a gem dragon empowers your mind. You gain resistance to psychic damage.

In addition, you learn the [telekinesis](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/telekinesis.md) spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spellcasting ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma when you cast the spell with this gift (choose when you gain the gift).
