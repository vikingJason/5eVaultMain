# Tavern
*Expansion*  

*Downtime and drink are essential to adventurers and garrisoned soldiers alike. A tavern always carries within it the often sweet fragrance of what it brews, from plum brandy to apple cider to hoppy ale to refined wine. Typically, taverns find themselves filled with the head and crackling staccato of a log fire, the honeyed lyrics of bard song, and words whispered between furtive folk.*

For those that live in and nearby the structure, the tavern often makes life much more enjoyable. The owners of this structure add `1d4` to any Charisma or [Insight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight) checks they make involving those who regularly use the tavern, which is generally expected to be almost all of those that live within the structure, as well as an assortment of those that live nearby.

When taking the [Downtime Activity: Carousing](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-carousing-xge.md) downtime activity (XGE, p. 126-128) at a tavern you own, you have advantage on the Charisma ([Persuasion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check you make at the end of it, as well as adding the `1d4` to that check.

Additionally, when you take the [Downtime Activity: Gambling](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-gambling-xge.md) downtime activity (XGE, p. 130-131) at a tavern you own, you can reroll your choice of a single one of the checks the activity would have you make, as well as adding the `1d4` to each of the checks.

Running a tavern requires a tavernkeep, a skilled hireling trained in [Persuasion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) whose salary is covered by the 2 gp maintenance cost. As an option, you can increase the maintenance cost to 4 gp to hire an additional skilled hireling proficient with [brewer's supplies](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/brewers-supplies.md) to act as a brewer.

If the tavern has both a tavernkeep and a brewer, this structure is considered to be the permanent home of an alcohol and refreshment merchant. The quality of this merchant's goods changes every 30 days, but it can never be less than poor, and is rerolled if it would ever be lower than this quality.

**Income.** If the tavern has only a tavernkeep, it generates an income of 210 gp (or 2d6 × 30 gp) every 30 days. If the tavern has both a tavernkeep and a brewer, the high-quality alcohol it produces increases the income to 315 gp (or 3d6 × 30 gp) every 30 days.
