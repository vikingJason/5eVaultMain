# Fragment of Deception
*Fragment of Suffering*  

## Benefit

When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until the start of your next turn or until you make a damage roll or cast a spell.

## Drawback

You have disadvantage on Wisdom checks.
