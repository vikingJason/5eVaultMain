# Charm of Biting Cold

> [!note]
> This charm can be bestowed by a [chwinga](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-toa.md) living in Icewind Dale or other cold regions by using their Magical Gift action.

This charm has 3 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to wreathe your weapon attacks with biting cold for 1 minute. Until this effect ends, you deal an extra `1d6` cold damage when you hit with a melee or ranged weapon attack. Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.
