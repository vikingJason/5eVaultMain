# Fragment of Rancor
*Fragment of Suffering*  

## Benefit

When you hit a creature with an attack, you can choose to deal either an extra `2d6` psychic damage to the creature or `4d6` psychic damage to each other creature within 5 feet of it. After you use this benefit, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Drawback

Whenever you are not [unconscious](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and fail a saving throw, you take `2d6` psychic damage.
