# Ephara's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Ephara trait*

You gain advantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks while you are within a city.

In addition, when you fail an Intelligence check or Intelligence saving throw, you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll. Once you use this reroll, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
