# Bank
*Expansion*  

*An enormous room filled with shining marble, brass, and heavily locked vaults, a bank does an excellent job of containing coinage and valuables, using money to make money.*

- **Size Cost.** 2 room points  
- **Construction Cost.** 5,000 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 30 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 10 gp per day (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Treasure hoard  

This room contains four 30-foot by 40-foot vaults, each with a 20-foot tall ceiling. The owners of this structure and their allies can stash any amount of gold or reasonably-sized treasure in one of the vaults, which requires a key to access (one key comes standard with each vault).

Unguarded vaults can be broken into by making five successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Thieves' Tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools.md)) checks, each of which takes 10 minutes. The vault doors are a three-foot thick, 5-foot radius circle of steel by default, with an AC of 19 and 25 hit points.

When you first build this room, or as a room modification at a later time, you can expend an additional 2,500 gp and 15 days of effort to build mithral doors (AC of 21, 50 hit points) for the vaults, or you can expend an additional 5,000 gp and 30 days of effort to build the vaults with adamantine doors (AC of 23, 100 hit points)

**Income.** If the maintenance cost for this room is paid in order to staff this room with 5 skilled hirelings trained in either [Insight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight) or [Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation), they can be instructed to manage the currency stored within, investing it or using it to make favorable trades. If this is the case, roll `1d4` every 30 days. On a roll of 2-4, the room generates an income equal to 5% of the total currency stored there. On a roll of 1, however, the investments don't pay off, and 5% of the currency stored within the room is lost.
