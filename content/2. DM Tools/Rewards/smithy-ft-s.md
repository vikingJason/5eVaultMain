This room is considered to always have the following sets of tools available: [carpenter's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/carpenters-tools.md), [jeweler's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/jewelers-tools.md), [leatherworker's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/leatherworkers-tools.md), [smith's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/smiths-tools.md), [tinker's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinkers-tools.md), and [woodcarver's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/woodcarvers-tools.md). These tools are always present in this room, and individuals that are proficient with these tools can create items in half the normal time and with half the crafting cost while working in this room, using the existing crafting downtime activity rules ([Downtime Activity: Crafting](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-crafting.md); [Downtime Activity: Crafting an Item](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/downtime-activity-crafting-an-item-xge.md)). This room can be built multiple times.

If you pay the maintenance cost to hire a skilled hireling proficient with a relevant type of artisan's tools, choose a merchant of one of the following types: furniture and interior decor, jewelry and gems, knick-knacks, leatherworking, mechanical contraptions, medium and heavy armor, tools, vehicles and transportation, or weapons. The quality of this merchant's goods changes every 30 days, but it can never be less than poor, and is rerolled if it would ever be lower than this quality

**Income.** Additionally, if the maintenance cost is paid, this room generates an income of 198 gp (or 1d10 Ã— 36 gp) every 30 days.
