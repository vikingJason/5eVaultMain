# Armory
*Expansion*  

*A stockpile of common weapons and armor, an armory provides defenses to the defenseless, as well as granting common people the ability to strike back and defend their home.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  

When the structure is under attack, any hireling that is not a spellcaster or soldier and that the structure requires for maintenance can visit the armory and afterwards count as a [guard](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) (MM, p. 347), up to a maximum number of hirelings equal to 5 Ã— your structure's room points.

Hirelings equipped in this way can also be used offensively rather than simply in defense of the structure. Doing so deprives a structure of its hireling staff, however, and removing more than a quarter of your structure's hirelings from its grounds will cause any other benefits the structure provides to cease, as the hirelings left behind struggle to cover for those absent.
