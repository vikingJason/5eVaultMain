# Library
*Expansion*  

*Stacks of books piled high to the ceiling, light filtering in from dusty windows, the library is a sanctum of knowledge and research. Material on any subject matter may be found here, if one has the time to search for it.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Archives, scriptorium  

When a creature takes at least 1 hour to peruse this room, it can choose to make an Intelligence or Wisdom based skill check to find specific knowledge within this room. Even if the creature does not (or cannot) succeed on this roll, it can typically uncover a hint as to where else in the world this information may be found.

If the maintenance cost for this room is paid to hire a skilled hireling proficient in at least one Intelligence based skill as a librarian, a creature requires only 1 minute instead of 1 hour to peruse the room, and the check the creature makes has advantage.
