# Purphoros's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Purphoros trait*

As a devotee of Purphoros, you have drawn the notice of the forge god with your skill. You can cast [shield of faith](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shield-of-faith.md) with this trait, requiring no material components, a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, you know the [mending](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mending.md) cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
