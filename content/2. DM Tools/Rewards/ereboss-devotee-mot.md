# Erebos's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Erebos trait*

As a devotee of Erebos, you have proven yourself an executor of the Underworld's grim laws. You can call on Erebos's favor to cast [bane](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bane.md) with this trait, requiring no material components, a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
