# Hospital
*Expansion*  

*This place of healing is as comfortable and inviting as one can make it, but it cannot entirely escape the ominous shroud of disease and death*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Clinic, medicine hut  

A creature that finishes a short or long rest here has its hit point maximum increased by an amount equal to the structure's total room points, and is healed up to its hit point maximum. This increase lasts until the creature finishes another long rest.

Additionally, if the creature is suffering from any diseases or the [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition, the creature can make a Constitution saving throw with advantage at the end of any rest it takes here, ending the disease or condition on a success. The DC for this saving throw is 15, unless the disease or condition would have a DC that is lower.

If the maintenance cost for this room is paid to staff it with a skilled hireling proficient in [Medicine](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine) that acts as a doctor, a creature that takes a rest here uses the maximum possible value for any hit dice it expends to heal, instead of rolling, until it finishes its next long rest.
