# Rookery
*Expansion*  

*The cawing of crows and ravens fills the air here, creating a dissonant chorus in this place of communication.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp (optional)  

This room houses a number of crows, ravens, pigeons, owls, hawks, or similar birds equal to your structure's total room points. While in this room, a creature can attach a message to one of these birds and give it instructions for delivery. This acts identically to a casting of the [animal messenger](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-messenger.md) spell, save that the message is written, not spoken, can be up to 50 words, and is delivered in the form of a tiny scroll.

If you pay the maintenance cost to staff this room with a skilled hireling proficient in [Animal Handling](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling) who acts as a master of ravens, the room can instead hold a number of birds equal to twice the structure's total room points, and the duration of the room's effect that mimics animal messenger is 48 hours instead of 24 hours.
