# Nylea's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Nylea trait*

As a devotee of Nylea, you have proven yourself a guardian of the wilds. You can cast [hunter's mark](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hunters-mark.md) with this trait a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
