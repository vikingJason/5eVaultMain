# Teleportation rune
*Modification*  

*A small rune resembling a gate is carved into a flagstone, support beam, or the underside of a table here. For those select few who know its true meaning, the rune is as functional as a doorway while being significantly more subtle.*

- **Construction Cost.** 3,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 25 days  
- **Requirements.** A structure with at least 3 total room points, a creature that can cast at least one 5th-level spell  

When this rune is first created, choose a command word. Any creature that touches this rune and speaks its command word can instantly teleport to any other room of that creature's choice in the same structure that also contains a copy of this rune built as a modification in that room.

All such runes within one structure share the same command word, and if only a single one of these runes exists within a structure, it does nothing until at least one other rune is built in a different room.
