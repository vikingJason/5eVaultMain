# Market Stalls
*Expansion*  

*Festive flags span across this open and vivacious courtyard while the sounds of animated haggling and the subtle clink of currency changing hands punctuate the air. Business is good enough here to warrant a permanent residence from merchants seeking small fortunes.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Shops  

Choose three merchants from the [Merchants](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/merchants-ft-s.md) table in the "Traders and Merchants" section. These merchants are in permanent residence at your structure, though the quality of their goods changes every 30 days.

This room can be built multiple times.

**Income.** If your structure is located in an area that can reasonably expect trade, this room generates an income of 210 gp (or 2d6 x 30 gp) every 30 days.
