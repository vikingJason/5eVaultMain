# Dark Gift of Savnok the Inscrutible
*Charm*  

Savnok's gift is the power to shield the mind. This dark gift takes the form of a [mind blank](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mind-blank.md) spell cast on the beneficiary. The spell has an extended duration of 1 year, after which the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary's eyes melt away upon receiving this dark gift, leaving empty sockets that can still see.
