# Charm of Lesser Conscription

While you have this charm, you attract flies. As an action, you activate this charm to summon a [barbed devil](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/barbed-devil.md), two [bearded devils](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/bearded-devil.md), or three [spined devils](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/spined-devil.md). All devils appear at once in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of you. Each devil obeys your commands and serves you eagerly for 9 days or until it dies, whereupon the devil disappears. Once all devils summoned by this charm disappear, the charm vanishes from you.
