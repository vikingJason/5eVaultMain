*Expansion*  

*Improperly planned, war can be a nightmare. With adequate planning supply lines, and intelligence, though, warfare becomes a much more feasible enterprise.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Bureaucrat's office  

While in this structure or fighting in its defense within 5 miles of it, any guard and other hireling using the [guard](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/guard.md) stat block (MM, p. 347) friendly to the owners of this structure can instead uses the statistics of a [scout](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) (MM, p. 349), but still only require its regular daily payment

Additionally, all soldier hirelings of any type friendly to the owners of this structure have advantage on initiative rolls while within 5 miles of this structure. Whenever such a hireling rolls initiative while within this radius, it gains temporary hit points equal to the total room points of this structure (maximum 10) that last for up to 1 minute or until they are lost.
