# Alchemist's Lab
*Expansion*  

*Glass-blown tubes, alembics, piping, and jars line the walls in dusty candle-lit shelves. The air is musky with the smell of dried herbs, as to the side a cauldron bubbles rhythmically atop an open flame.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Can Also Be.** Apothecary, herbalist  

This room comes equipped with [alchemist's supplies](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-supplies.md), a [poisoner's kit](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/poisoners-kit.md) and an [herbalism kit](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md) that are all inherently part of its architecture. As such, each of these sets of tools is always considered to be present here.

Additionally, a creature proficient with alchemist's supplies has a bonus to crafting magic items in the potion category of rare quality or lesser while within this room. A creature proficient with the poisoner's kit has this same bonus when crafting poisons within this room, such as [Basic Poison](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/basic-poison-vial.md) or any of the poisons listed on pages [257-258 of the Dungeon Master's Guide](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/poisons.md). In either case, it takes the creature a quarter of the normal time to craft the item in question, and it costs half as much of the usual gold. This bonus is not cumulative with similar bonuses from class features or other sources.
