# Lodgings
*Expansion*  

*At the end of a long day, a hot meal, warm bed, and cozy fire are often just enough to keep most people happy. Enticing  more individuals to dwell in your structure means being able to provide all three of these amenities.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp (optional)  
- **Can Also Be.** Barracks, guest rooms, spare cots, servant's quarters  

While a structure is usually considered to have adequate lodging for its owners and its hireling staff, additional housing for guests, soldiers, or other visitors may be necessary. This room can be built multiple times.

When constructed, choose one of the following options for this room:

- **Bunks.** This room can hold and house up to 100 individuals and their supplies in communal bunks.  
- **Bedrooms.** This room can hold and house up to 24 individuals in 6 private bedrooms, up to 4 persons per room.  

**Income.** If this room is in a structure that can reasonably expect paying travelers, you chose to build bedrooms, and you decide for this room to act as an inn to visitors, then you can choose to pay the maintenance cost in order to hire a skilled hireling proficient either in [cook's utensils](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/cooks-utensils.md) or with [Persuasion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) to act as an innkeeper. If you do, this room then generates an income of 220 gp (or 1d10 Ã— 40 gp) every 30 days.
