# Klothys's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Klothys trait*

As a devotee of Klothys, you can manipulate the bonds of destiny that invisibly entangle every living thing. You can cast [command](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/command.md) with this trait a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
