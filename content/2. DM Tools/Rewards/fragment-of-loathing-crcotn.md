# Fragment of Loathing
*Fragment of Suffering*  

## Benefit

When a creature damages you with a weapon attack or a spell, you can focus your hatred on that creature. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on attack rolls you make against the creature. You can focus your hatred on only one creature at a time.

## Drawback

You have disadvantage on Charisma checks.
