# Lecture Hall
*Expansion*  

*These hallowed halls of learning are just as likely to guide the young to greatness as to play host to any number of formative shenanigans.*

- **Size Cost.** 1 room point  
- **Construction Cost.** 2,500 gp  
- **Construction Time.** 15 days  
- **Daily Maintenance Cost.** 2 gp, 4gp, or 6 gp  
- **Can Also Be.** Schoolhouse, training grounds  

Classes are held in this room, instructing those within on any number of topics. This room can be built multiple times.

The maintenance cost for this room hires a number of skilled hirelings proficient with any set of tools or in any Wisdom or Intelligence skill, who act as teachers. Choose the amount to pay; the maintenance cost hires 1 teacher for 2 gp, 2 teachers for 4 gp, or 3 teachers for 6 gp.

Select a number of types of lessons to be taught in this room from the following list, equal to the number of teachers working in this room, as well as the specifics of what each lesson teaches. A single type of lesson can be chosen multiple times, but each must have a different subject (for example, "Language Lesson" can be chosen twice, but a different language must be selected for each).

- **Language Lesson.** Teaches a language you choose.  
- **Skill Lesson.** Teaches proficiency in a [skills](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/skills.md) which the hireling teacher is proficient in.  
- **Spell Lesson.** Teaches a cantrip of your choice to a creature that can cast at least one spell with a spell level. The cantrip must be on the spell list of a class the creature belongs to, and doesn't count against the number of cantrips the creature can know.  
- **Tool Lesson.** Teaches proficiency with a set of [tools, a musical instrument, or a gaming set](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/tools.md) with which the hireling teacher is proficient.  
- **Weapon Lesson.** Teaches proficiency with a [weapon](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/weapons.md) you choose.  

Each day, a creature in the structure can attend one lesson of its choice, which lasts for 6 hours that day. Once the creature has attended the class for a number of days equal to 30 – twice its Intelligence modifier, the creature is considered to have learned the lesson's subject matter. If an unskilled hireling completes a lesson, it becomes a skilled hireling (complete with an increase in its wage).

A creature can only benefit from a number of lessons equal to its proficiency bonus, and does not absorb any lessons from this room (or any other instance of this room in this or other structures) beyond that limit

**Income.**  If this room accepts students and charges tuition, this room generates an income of 110 gp (or 1d10 × 20 gp) with 1 teacher, 220 gp (or 2d10 × 20 gp) with 2 teachers, or 330 gp (or 3d10 × 20 gp) with 3 teachers.
