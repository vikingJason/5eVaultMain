# Phenax's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Phenax trait*

As a devotee of Phenax, you have proven yourself accomplished at deception. You can call on Phenax's blessing and cast [disguise self](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self.md) with this trait. While the spell is active, your shadow still resembles your original form. You can cast the spell in this way a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
