# Athreos's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Athreos trait*

You can cast [speak with dead](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-dead.md) with this trait, requiring no material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
