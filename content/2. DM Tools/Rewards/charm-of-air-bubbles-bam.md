# Charm of Air Bubbles

> [!note]
> This charm can be bestowed by a [chwinga astronaut](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/chwinga-astronaut-bam.md) using their Magical Gift action.

This charm allows you to cast the [Air Bubble](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/air-bubble-aag.md) spell (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) as an action. Once used three times, this charm goes away.
