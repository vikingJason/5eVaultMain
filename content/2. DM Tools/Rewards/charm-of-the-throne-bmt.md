# Charm of the Throne

You can cast [Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/mordenkainens-magnificent-mansion.md), requiring no spell components and using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Once used three times, the charm vanishes from you.
