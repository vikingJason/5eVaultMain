## ABOUT THIS BOOK

This book is the companion to Return of the Lazy DM. That book explores what it means to get more out of our fantasy roleplaying games by preparing less. It focuses on how we prepare our games, run our games, and think about our games.

This workbook is intended to give you specific tools to prepare and run a fifth edition fantasy roleplaying game, with a focus on light preparation and heavy improvisation.

It’s probably easiest to think of this book as an extended Gamemaster screen. It’s packed with tables, checklists, and fill-in pages. It also has ten “lazy lairs,” providing you with maps and descriptions of some of the most common fantasy locations, ready to drop right into your game.

The goal for this workbook is to give you a toolbox you can carry with you and keep on hand as you prepare and run your games. It’s specifically designed to help you quickly plan a session and let you improvise a detailed and rich game—one that can surprise both your players and you.

### HOW TO USE THIS BOOK

Get familiar with this book by skimming each of its sections. In particular, read the instructions included at the beginning of each section so you know what’s intended for each of the main sets of tools. Then look at the tools themselves. Roll a few dice using the random tables to generate some examples, and get a sense of how they might work for you.

Take a look at the lazy lair maps so you know what you have on hand. That way, you can jump to a lair when your characters enter a location you hadn’t expected— the old sewers beneath the city, the smugglers’ den near the docks, or that strange wizard’s tower that hasn’t been explored in centuries.

Once you have a sense of what resources the workbook provides, consider keeping it by your side when you prepare your next game. Take a look at the “Lazy DM’s Checklist” section. Then use the tables in the workbook to generate ideas when you’re looking for interesting town events, fantastic features, treasure, or traps.

When you’re running your game, use the “Fifth Edition Reference” section if you need quick and easy access to information. Then jump to the random tables if something comes up that you’re not ready for.

Feel free to hack up the PDF of this workbook to focus on the information you like and dump what you don’t need. As with every aspect of the way of the Lazy DM, use what works and omit what does not.

### LAZY DM PREPARATION

The following page consolidates a number of the checklists featured at the end of each chapter in Return of the Lazy DM. It’s intended to help you remember the material in that book and quickly consider it while preparing for your games. This reference won’t be much good unless you’ve read Return of the Lazy DM, or have at least given it a solid skim. When you have, use the checklist to help you reinforce the ideas that work for you.

Now let’s go prep and run some games.

## FIFTH EDITION REFERENCE

The following five pages include reference material specifically designed for fifth edition fantasy roleplaying. This page provides a summary of those materials.

**Skills and Abilities:** This reference summarizes fifth edition skills and their associated abilities. Use this table to remember what skills can come into play in the game when calling for an ability check. Remember that skills can be associated with other abilities if it makes sense for the situation.

**Typical Difficulty Classes:** This table provides a rough gauge of various ability check and saving throw DCs, presenting the perceived difficulty of each. These guidelines allow you to assign DCs based on relative challenge, and are independent of character level.

**Improvised Statistics:** Use this table to quickly generate statistics for traps, hazards, challenges, fantastic features, physical objects, and any other features that can deal or take damage. The level noted on the table doesn’t necessarily correlate to the level of the player characters. Rather, it represents the level of the challenge. If 3rd-level characters wander into a 7th- level dungeon, then traps featuring statistics from the Level 5–7 row of the table are what they should face.

These statistics are not intended to represent monsters, even if you have the need or desire to improvise monsters at the table. Instead, consider reskinning an existing monster (see chapter 15 of Return of the Lazy DM).

**Actions in Combat:** This section lists the various actions that characters and monsters can take in combat.

**Cover, Light, and Visibility:** These references summarize how cover, light, and visibility work in fifth edition.

**Minimum Targets in Areas of Effect:** When you’re running combat either on an abstract map or in the theater of the mind, it helps to have a rough estimate of how many creatures might fit into an area. You can use this breakdown as a baseline for different areas of effect, then increase or decrease the number of creatures that might be affected based on the situation, the size and number of those creatures, and their positions.

**What Breaks Concentration:** This section provides references to the different situations that can break concentration for spellcasters and other characters.

**Conditions:** This section contains descriptions of the various fifth edition conditions and status effects.

**Exhaustion:** This section describes the various levels of exhaustion.

**Quick Encounter Building:** This reference is intended to help you quickly gauge the relative difficulty of a combat encounter for a specific group of characters. Use this information to compare the level of the characters, the challenge rating of the monsters, and the ratio of the number of monsters to the number of characters.

These guidelines are built around creating a hard encounter, but they’re not guaranteed to produce a balanced encounter. (In fact, there’s no such thing.) Rather, their primary purpose is to help you see whether an encounter might push from being hard to being deadly, so that you can give the players fair warning.

Running Large Numbers of Monsters: The stories and situations in your game have no limits, so that it’s possible for a group of characters to face three dozen orcs, or a hundred skeletons, or even larger groups of foes. But when you’re running more than a dozen monsters, rolling for every attack or saving throw can slow down the game to the point of making it unmanageable.

This section helps you adjudicate how many monsters will hit a target creature or succeed on a saving throw, given the difference between the attack score or DC of the attacker and the AC or saving throw of the defender. Also discussed in this section is the option to pool together the hit points of a large number of monsters, so that the characters can gain maximum effect from the damage they deal to those monsters individually.

These approaches to running large numbers of monsters require a bit of work to understand them. It’s worth testing these rules before you try to use them during your game.

**Madness:** Often underused, the rules for short-term and long-term madness can add flavorful status effects when characters interact with objects, beings, or energy from realms beyond the limits of the mortal mind. These effects are often imposed when a character fails a Charisma saving throw, with a DC based on the nature of the source of the madness.

- Being incapacitated or killed
- Environmental phenomena (DC 10 Constitution saving throw)

### CONDITIONS

- **Blinded:** The creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.
- **Charmed:** The creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.
- **Deafened:** The creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.
- **Frightened:** The creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
- **Grappled:** The creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated. The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect.
- **Incapacitated:** The creature can’t take actions or reactions.
- **Invisible:** The creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.
- **Paralyzed:** The creature is incapacitated and can’t move or speak. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
- **Petrified:** A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. The creature has resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.
- **Poisoned:** The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
- **Prone:** The creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
- **Restrained:** The creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
- **Stunned:** The creature is incapacitated, can’t move, and can speak only falteringly. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
- **Unconscious:** The creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

### EXHAUSTION

Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in its description. Effects are cumulative.

- **Level 1:** Disadvantage on ability checks
- **Level 2:** Speed halved
- **Level 3:** Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
- **Level 4:** Hit point maximum halved
- **Level 5:** Speed reduced to 0
- **Level 6:** Death

### QUICK ENCOUNTER BUILDING

When building encounters, start by choosing the type and number of monsters that make sense for the situation.

Then use the following guidelines to compare the challenge rating of the monsters, the level of the characters, and the ratio of monsters to characters. If the quantity of monsters or their challenge rating is beyond the indicated guidelines, the encounter might be deadly. Be especially careful with potentially deadly encounters when the characters are 1st level.

#### BUILDING ENCOUNTERS FOR CHARACTERS OF 1ST LEVEL

- **CR 0 to 1/4:** One monster per character
- **CR 1/2:** One monster per two characters
- **CR 1:** One monster per four characters

#### BUILDING ENCOUNTERS FOR CHARACTERS OF 2ND TO 4TH LEVEL

- **CR = 1/10 level:** Two monsters per character
- **CR = 1/4 level:** One monster per character
- **CR = 1/2 level:** One monster per two characters
- **CR = Level:** One monster per four characters

#### BUILDING ENCOUNTERS FOR CHARACTERS OF 5TH TO 20TH LEVEL

- **CR = 1/10 level:** Four monsters per character
- **CR = 1/4 level:** Two monsters per character
- **CR = 1/2 level:** One monster per character
- **CR = 3/4 level:** One monster per two characters
- **CR = Level + 3:** One monster per four characters

Finally, tune encounters by adjusting the number of monsters, increasing or decreasing hit points, or making named or unique monsters more powerful.

**Hit Points:** Standard monster hit points are an average of the monster’s HD range. You can increase or decrease hit points within that range to model particularly weak or particularly strong monsters.

To make a fight easier, you can also treat monsters as “instant minions,” ignoring their usual hit points and letting a single attack kill them. Having a few enemies die quickly can turn the tide in favor of the characters and keep a battle from feeling stale.

**Named Monsters:** Adding an extra attack or maximizing damage can make a named monster or unique foe more challenging. Named monsters can also be given legendary actions or the Legendary Resistance feature to make the fight more interesting.

### RUNNING LARGE NUMBERS OF MONSTERS

**For Attacks:** Subtract the monsters’ attack modifier from the defender’s AC and consult the Result column. Determine the number of monsters who hit by dividing the total number of monsters by the number indicated under Monsters per Single Success. If the monsters that hit have advantage, double their damage dealt. If they have more than one attack, multiply the damage by the number of attacks.

**For Saving Throws:** Subtract the monsters’ saving throw modifier from the effect’s saving throw DC, and consult the Result column. Determine the number of monsters that succeed on the saving throw by dividing the total number of monsters by the number indicated under Monsters per Single Success.

| Result | Monsters per Single Success |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| < 6    | 1                           |
| 6–12   | 2                           |
| 13–14  | 3                           |
| 15–16  | 4                           |
| 17–18  | 5                           |
| 19     | 10                          |
| 20+    | 20                          |

**Pooling Hit Points:** When running a large number of monsters, consider pooling their hit points together. Then subtract the damage dealt by characters to any of those monsters from the pool, instead of tracking damage to each monster independently.

Every time the pool takes damage equal to the hit point value of a monster, one monster dies. For example, in an encounter against twenty-five skeletons with 13 hit points each, the pool has a total of 325 hit points. If a fighter swings a great sword and hits for 29 damage, the pool is reduced by 29 and two skeletons die.

Each time a monster dies because an effect automatically deals enough damage to kill it, its hit points are deducted from the pool. For example, if a sorcerer hits eight skeletons with a fireball spell (dealing a minimum of 14 fire damage on a successful save), each of the eight skeletons takes 13 damage and dies, and the pool is reduced by 104 hit points.

| 56–65  | The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 66–75  | The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity.                                                           |
| 76–85  | The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. |
| 86–90  | Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.            |
| 91–95  | The character loses the ability to speak.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 96–100 | The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.                                                                                                                                             |

## RANDOM TABLES

The following pages provide options for creating NPCs, locations, and other adventure features on the fly.

If a randomly rolled element from any of the tables in this section feels out of place for your game, just reroll. However, you might also use that as a challenge to come up with ways to make unusual elements fit.

**Names:** Whenever you need a name for an NPC, you can find one quickly and easily using the lists on the “Fantasy Names” page. Two lists providing hundreds of pregenerated names have been nominally separated into given names and surnames, but you’re free to use them however you wish.

You can also use surnames to name adventuring parties, mercenary gangs, and other such organizations—for example, the Dawn Seekers, the Earth Fangs, or the Shield Cleavers.

**Traps:** The “Traps” page presents five tables you can use to generate simple or complex traps, incorporating multiple features, plus energy damage or conditions.

To generate a simple trap, just roll on the Physical Trap table and the Trigger table. For a more dangerous trap, add an effect from the Flavor table to put a unique twist on the damage or impose a debilitating condition. For a really devious trap, you can roll on the Flavor table and Physical Trap table twice, combining features into deadly combinations such as ‘sleep-inducing bolos and thunderous crushing pillars, triggered by an onyx demon’s skull.’

The tables at the bottom of the page provide guidelines for choosing DCs, attack bonuses, and damage for traps, based on how challenging you want them to be.

**Monuments:** Filling the various chambers and locations in your game with interesting features is always a challenge—and can be even more difficult to improvise. The “Monuments” page presents four tables that can generate fantastic features with a number of potential effects. As with the “Traps” page, you don’t need to roll on every table each time you want to generate a feature. Sometimes, just establishing the condition and the type of a feature is enough to give you a starting point. Then you can let the story or even the background of one of the characters guide the feature’s additional elements.

The Unusual Effect table can come into play whenever you want a feature to add interesting effects to a combat encounter. You can use the improvised statistics in the “Fifth Edition Reference” section to flesh out the mechanics for these effects or simply tie the effect to a spell.

Items: The “Items” page allows you to generate all sorts of useful relics and objects, from mundane discoveries to powerful magical artifacts. As with the other sections, you can choose which of the tables you want to roll on, depending on your goal. If you want to come up with an interesting magic weapon, for example, you might roll on the Item Condition, Item Origin, Weapon, and Spell Effect tables. If you just want a weird mundane item, roll on the Item Condition, Item Origin, and Mundane Item tables without adding any effect.

Some strange relics might allow a single use of a powerful magical spell. Roll on the Item Condition, Item Origin, Mundane Item, and Spell Effect table to generate a unique single-use magical relic.

Also included on the “Items” page is a table noting the four types of healing potion and how many hit points each potion restores.

Town Events: Whenever the characters enter a new town or start a new session there, adding some detail and context to the setting can help bring things to life. The “Town Events” page features four tables to help determine what might be going on in a town, how the townsfolk are currently feeling, what the weather is, and what mundane or fantastic event might be taking place. As with the other random table sections, you need only make use of whichever tables you need for a given point in your game.

## RANDOM DUNGEON MONSTER TABLES

The following two pages feature a set of tables to randomly select monsters based on “dungeon level.” Although these charts are built for old–school dungeon delving, you can use them to generate randomly encountered monsters in just about any setting— a ruin, an old church, caves, catacombs, an old wizard’s tower, or some other forgotten lair.

### USING THESE TABLES

To use these tables, first decide what dungeon level the characters are on. This might correspond to the level of the characters but it doesn’t have to. If 2nd-level characters decide to descend to dungeon level 5, so be it.

Once you have a dungeon level selected, roll a d20 and look across to see which monster table you should use. For example, if the characters are on dungeon level 4 and you roll a 12, you’ll use monster table 3.

Then go to the indicated monster table on the next page and roll a d20 again, to determine which monster might show up. Using the above example, consulting monster table 3 and rolling a 3 gives a result of ‘Ghoul.’

Instead of using dungeon levels, you can just jump to whichever monster table feels right for the circumstances. If you know you’re looking for a monster with a challenge rating of 4 or 5, just roll on Monster Table 6.

You can also use these tables to quickly look up monsters at particular challenge ratings. Even if you absolutely hate random encounters, you can use the tables to generate encounter ideas you might never think of otherwise.

### SELECTING THE NUMBER OF MONSTERS

There are a few ways to choose the number of monsters in an encounter. First, think about what makes sense. Ghouls travel in packs, but a rug of smothering is probably found alone. You might roll dice to determine the number of monsters—for example, 3d6 ghouls. You might also choose to have one monster leading others—a pack of ghouls led by a ghast, for example.

Before the number of monsters is set, you can gauge whether your intended encounter is deadly or not by using the “Quick Encounter Building” guidelines (the next section in this book). Or make use of the following quick summary (from the “Fifth Edition Reference” section). If the quantity of monsters or their challenge rating is beyond the indicated guidelines, the encounter might be deadly. Be especially careful with potentially deadly encounters when the characters are 1st level.

#### NUMBER OF MONSTERS FOR CHARACTERS OF 1ST LEVEL

- CR 0 to 1/4: One monster per character
- CR 1/2: One monster per two characters
- CR 1: One monster per four characters

#### NUMBER OF MONSTERS FOR CHARACTERS OF 2ND TO 4TH LEVEL

- CR = 1/10 level: Two monsters per character
- CR = 1/4 level: One monster per character
- CR = 1/2 level: One monster per two characters
- CR = Level: One monster per four characters

#### NUMBER OF MONSTERS FOR CHARACTERS OF 5TH TO 20TH LEVEL

- CR = 1/10 level: Four monsters per character
- CR = 1/4 level: Two monsters per character
- CR = 1/2 level: One monster per character
- CR = 3/4 level: One monster per two characters
- CR = Level + 3: One monster per four characters

Always remember that encounter-building methods such as these for 5e games are loose guidelines, not hard rules. Use them as a starting point, but pay attention to how things are going at the table. If the challenge of an encounter turns out drastically different than you expected, adjust the encounter as necessary.

## 5E ENCOUNTER BUILDING GUIDELINES

### ENCOUNTER BUILDING TIPS

- Choose monsters that make sense for the current situation and story. When needed, use the chart below to determine if an encounter is potentially deadly.
- Tune battles by increasing or decreasing hit points, damage, or the number of monsters.
- Many factors can alter the difficulty of a fight, including player experience, character synergy, encounter circumstances, and the state of the party’s resources.
- Take it easy on 1st-level characters. They’re squishy.
- Your experience as a GM will eventually be a better gauge of encounter balance than this or any other chart.

### USING THIS CHART

Start off by finding the row containing the level of the characters. Then find the cell containing the challenge rating closest to the CR of the monsters you’ve selected for the encounter.

The column header of that cell tells you the ratio of the number of monsters to characters. If there are more monsters of a higher challenge rating then the chart recommends, the encounter could be potentially deadly.

For example, a group of four 5th-level characters stumbles into a camp of four ogres (CR 2). Checking the row for 5th-level characters, you then look across to find CR 2. The column header tells you that the ideal ratio is one monster per character. Since you have four characters facing four monsters, this encounter isn’t likely to be deadly.

#### Monster Challenge Rating

## GUIDELINES FOR THEATER-OF-THE-MIND COMBAT

The following guidelines can help Gamemasters run combat in the “theater of the mind,” without the need for a gridded battle map or miniatures. This style of combat takes the emphasis away from tactical features such as distance, range, and the specific size of areas of effect. Instead, it focuses on the in-game action, the intent of the characters, and what happens in the story.

This style of combat works just like any other scene in your game. On each player’s turn, **you describe the current situation, the players describe their intent, and you adjudicate what happens as a result.**

Theater-of-the-mind combat requires that the players trust you as the Gamemaster, knowing that you’ll describe the situation and adjudicate the results of the characters’ actions fairly. As the GM, you’ll **earn this trust** by favoring the players whenever possible, and by focusing on sharing an action-packed story.

Running theater-of-the-mind combat removes agency from the players. It takes away their ability to control every aspect of how their characters move and what they do. As GM, you can mitigate this by **asking each player for their intent** each turn, then helping them meet that intent. For example, a player who says “I move close to the orcs” potentially leaves too many possibilities open. So encourage the player to focus their intent more—perhaps along the lines of, “I want to position myself so that at least two orcs are within the reach of my glaive.”

When playing in the theater of the mind, both you and the players must worry **less about the mechanical details of the game.** Instead, everyone will **focus on the action and the story.**

### SUMMARY GUIDELINES FOR THE GM

- Each turn, describe the situation surrounding the characters.
- Ask for the players’ intent and help them achieve it.
- Be generous. Give players the benefit of the doubt.
- Use ability checks to let the characters try crazy ideas.
- Ask the players to describe interesting physical characteristics of the monsters, and use these to identify monsters during combat.
- Bring characters into the story by asking them to describe their killing blows.
- When needed, use sketches, abstract maps, or miniatures to show complicated locations and relative positions.

### SUMMARY GUIDELINES FOR PLAYERS

- Describe your intent. What you want to accomplish?
- Use the features of the area to your advantage.
- Don’t worry about specific distances. Just describe what you want to do.
- Try awesome ideas based on the details of the location.
- Describe your character’s actions within the story.

### MOVEMENT, DISTANCE, AND RANGE

At the beginning of combat, you describe the situation, features, distances, and arrangements of the creatures in the area. Assuming a moderately sized combat area, any creature can generally move within 5 feet of any other creature, and every creature is within range of every other creature making ranged attacks. You’ll make it clear whenever this isn’t true, such as when an enemy is farther away or behind a front line of protective allies.

Characters with fast movement might have opportunities to move places other characters can’t.

### POSITIONING, OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS, AND COVER

On each player’s turn, they describe how they intend to position themselves. Examples of movement in the theater of the mind might include moving next to an ally, moving next to two enemies, or staying out of reach while attacking with a polearm.

If a creature is within an enemy’s reach, it will likely provoke an opportunity attack if it tries to move away from that enemy. Creatures able to disengage can do so and avoid opportunity attacks.

As you describe the features of the area, make a note of which ones can provide cover to the characters or their enemies, and how much cover.

### AREAS OF EFFECT

The following guidelines offer a rough baseline for determining the number of targets that fall within an area of effect. The circumstances of a battle can increase or decrease this number. For example, for larger monsters or monsters that are more spread out, an area of effect might target only half the normal number of creatures. For smaller monsters or monsters that are packed close together, an area of effect might include up to double the normal number of targets.

- Tiny Area: 1 or 2 creatures *(cloud of daggers)*
- Small Area: 2 creatures *(burning hands, thunderwave)*
- Large Area: 4 creatures *(cone of cold, fireball)*
- Huge Area: Everyone *(circle of death, earthquake)*
- Short Line: 2 creatures *(wall of fire)*
- Long Line: 3 creatures *(blade barrier, lightning bolt)*

Abilities like the evoker’s Sculpt Spells feature can increase the number of affected enemies, usually by one or two. Likewise, an area of effect that targets both the characters and their enemies might affect more total targets—including an effect created by a character or monster willing to put allies in harm’s way. If a spellcaster character wishes to place allies within an area of effect, you and the players should negotiate this before the spell is cast.

### LOCATIONS, FEATURES, ENVIRONMENT, AND TERRAIN

When first describing the combat encounter, describe notable locations, objects, environmental features, and terrain features. Write these down and keep them in front of the players if it helps them visualize the battlefield. Let the players know that they can interact with these environmental features, through such actions as swinging from magical chandeliers, climbing up obsidian cliffs to advantageous positions, or hiding behind ruined statues. If any feature or effect creates difficult terrain, let the players know how this might affect them, such as requiring that they use the Dash action to get out of the area.

### RANDOMLY SELECTED TARGETS

Avoid biases—whether perceived or actual—by randomly selecting targets when it isn’t clear which character a monster would attack. Rolling randomly for targets in the open can help build trust between you and the players, letting them know that the GM isn’t picking on anyone. Monsters aren’t idiots, though. If it’s clear that a monster would attack a particular character, such as a wizard concentrating on a dangerous spell, the monster will do so. When this happens, just describe why the monster chose that particular character, so the players understand.

### PHYSICAL TRAITS AND IDENTIFYING ENEMIES

Ask each player to describe the physical traits of a monster their character is attacking. This helps identify the monster, opens up all the players’ imaginations to the battle, and helps everyone know which monster is which using in-story descriptions. Write these physical traits down on a 3×5 index card or on a dry-erase flip mat so everyone can see which monsters are in play.

### GOING BIG WITH DESCRIPTIONS

Theater-of-the-mind combat can go stale if you don’t continually reinforce the story of what’s happening. Go big with your descriptions of the location and the action. Ask players to describe their attacks and killing blows. Between turns, describe the current situation using in-story language. These descriptions are vital to keeping the scene interesting.

## CONNECTING CHARACTERS

During your session zero of a new campaign, or if you’re running a single-session one-shot game, consider establishing connections between the characters to help build a cohesive bond between them before the game begins. This can help prevent ham-fisted and convoluted attempts to build a story that connects the characters, when all the players already know perfectly well that they’re coming together simply for the adventure.

This section presents two potential approaches to connecting characters. First, all the characters can be previously connected through a single organization, faction, or patron, using ideas from the Group Connections table. Alternatively, each character can establish a connection to one or more other characters through a personal relationship and history, using ideas from the Character Connections table. Players can work together to come up with these shared histories based on the overall themes of the campaign, or the group can randomly select potential relationships and tweak the results as desired.

For individual connections, each player can roll on the Character Connections table to establish a relationship with the character of the player on their right. Going once around the game table this way means that every character will have two relationships—one with the player on their right and one with the player on their left.

For single-session games, consider establishing a single group relationship for all the characters before the game begins. This relationship can directly tie into the story of the adventure, and will speed up the game by eliminating lengthy discussions about how the characters got together.

## LAZY LAIRS

The following pages contain the maps and descriptions for ten lazy lairs—quick adventure setups based around a number of commonly used fantasy-setting locations:

- Castle
- Docks
- Sewers
- Catacombs
- Caves
- Cellars
- Dungeon
- Mines
- Temple
- Wizard’s Tower

These lazy lairs are meant to help you improvise locations as they come up during your game. None of the lairs have descriptions of potential inhabitants or other story elements. Instead, you’ll generate and place these features yourself, so that each lair can provide the foundation for your own unique adventure.

The text description of each lair includes italicized text. This text can either be read aloud or used to help you summarize the location.

Each room description begins with the area’s aspects. These aspects can give you potential hooks for character exploration or environmental effects. They also help to define the area, so you don’t need to read the description out loud if you don’t want to. Instead, you can summarize the location by improvising your own descriptions of these aspects.

Many of these locations have transition points that can connect to other lairs. The castle has drain grates that can lead to the sewers, and an escape tunnel leading into hidden caves. The caves feature a connection to the sewers and a door that can lead to any underground location, and an underground river that might flow out to the docks. The crypts and the dungeon could connect to the temple, which in turn could connect back to the castle. You might even connect all ten lazy lairs into a single huge adventure site if you like.

You can likewise modify these dungeons to fit the size and scale of the adventure you want to run. Cave-ins and bricked-up walls can take a fourteen-room lair and turn it into a three-room lair, focusing it to fit the size of your adventure. You can also add in your own fantastic features to make any lair area unique.

As with everything else in this workbook, you should feel free to make changes to the lairs to suit your needs and the needs of your game.

### CASTLE

Gray stone walls protect the central keep of this fortress as they have for hundreds of years. Four sturdy towers and high walkways offer a clear view for miles around. Raised portcullises stand above the long stone entryway to the central courtyard.

### SEWERS

The smell of the foulest refuse of humanity wafts thickly through these slick tunnels, whose construction marks them as hundreds of years old. The sound of skittering claws on stone interrupts the continual dripping of liquid into the deep pools that fill these chambers.

The map of the sewers contains a number of crank wheels, sluices, and doors that can be open or shut to seal off or flood various parts of the complex. You should decide what these controls do in the sewers (if anything) before the characters start to work them. For example, sealing off certain flanges that control the flow of sewage or water might cause that flow to back up and flood the lower chambers.

Thick strands of ivy cover this ancient temple. Relief carvings of the gods stare out into the distance, cracks weathering their once-perfect faces. A set of large stone doors leads into the temple beyond.

#### WIZARD’S TOWER MAP

## FILL-IN PAGES

The following four pages are templates that you can use to write down vital information as you prepare and run your games. You are free to copy and print extra copies of these pages, as you need.

### SESSION WORKSHEET

This worksheet helps you walk through the eight steps of game preparation described in Return of the Lazy DM. When you’re not sure where to start to prepare for your next game, grab a copy of this sheet and use it to guide your prep.

You can save copies of these sheets to see how your adventure evolves from session to session, or just to keep a historical record of your game.

### CHARACTER TRACKER

This sheet can help you keep track of the player characters in your campaign—the first and often most vital step in game preparation. Putting the characters first and foremost ensures that the rest of your prep keeps the characters in mind, and puts them in the spotlight they deserve. The design of this sheet is purposefully open, to let you write down the things most important to you as you track the characters in your game.

### NPC TRACKER

When you’re running a game, things are happening fast and furiously. It’s easy to completely improvise an NPC, then forget about that character seconds later. This NPC tracker is intended to help you quickly write down NPCs as you create them in your game. Like the character tracker, the design of this sheet has been left open so you can add whatever information you find valuable in your game.

### CAMPAIGN PLANNER

The campaign planner sheet follows the campaign building approach discussed in Return of the Lazy DM.

Start with the primary campaign hook. This is the one-line description that describes what your campaign is about.

Then move on to the six truths of your world–the six things that set your campaign apart from all the other worlds and campaigns out there. These truths can help your players design their characters, and will help you focus on what makes your campaign unique.

Then go on to your campaign fronts—a concept borrowed from the excellent story-focused RPGs Apocalypse World and Dungeon World. Each of these fronts represents a primary mover in the campaign’s world. This might be three major villains, or it might be a mixture of villains, upcoming events, or major factions in the world.

These fronts represent the major motivators in the campaign that the characters will interact with. Each front has a primary goal and three grim portents. The goal is the point toward which the front moves. The grim portents are the three noticeable events that can take place and reveal to the characters that the front is moving forward. All these concepts are discussed in Return of the Lazy DM.

With these sheets in hand, you can easily keep track of your campaigns, adventures, characters, and NPCs, both during preparation and as you play.
