# Creating a Side Story
## Introduction
### In Medias Res
Means start from the middle, this could be used in several ways,
- The party is already in the middle of the action, after the encounter's over, you can narrate how they got here in the first place as a flashback.
> [!Example]- Tomb Raiding ( Prompt: Retrieve Item)
> Difficulty: Medium
> 
> The session opens up with the party running away from a tumbling boulder in a underground maze. The party enters a safe room after making some checks to avoid traps and the boulder. The party can take a break as you tell them how they have decided to retrieve a relic from a tomb of an ancient king and was paid in coins and equipment in advance and was promised for more payment if return with the item.

### TTRPG is in Essence, A Resource Management Game
Table Top RPG in a nutshell, a resource management game and you have to evoke that element to have the game engaging for the players. Knowing they have a journey ahead and until that mission is complete they cannot rest fully or resupplied gives tension to the players.

One thing that really helps is the set of time. The players will try to prepare themselves to the best or meander around too much before going to the main course. 

Limiting the time creates tension because they cannot have infinite abilities and spells. The way to create time limit is within the story. The rescuee will be executed at dawn. The party must find a safe place before the cavern floods with acid or competitors will take the prize if they do not hurry.

> [!example]- Capture the Saboteurs (Prompt: Capture Creature)
> You've gotten an antonymous tip the fort you are staying will be raided in two days with a help from three individuals from the inside wearing a black onyx ring on their right ring finger.
