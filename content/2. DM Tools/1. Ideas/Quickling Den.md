### **Quickling Den:**

The Quickling den is located deep in a forest where the boundaries between the Feywild and Material Plane blur. The air hums with a strange, vibrant energy, and colors seem slightly too vivid. The quicklings have made their home in the **"Whispering Grove,"** a maze-like area filled with towering trees, thick bushes, and dense fog that swirls unnaturally. Their den is concealed within a massive, hollowed-out tree and hidden from plain sight by a **Fey glamour**.

#### **Den Defenses:**

- **Natural Illusions:** The Feywild's magic creates confusing illusions around the grove, disorienting intruders. The trees seem to shift positions when looked at directly, and strange whispers fill the air, causing disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate without getting lost.
- **Quickling Watchers:** Several quicklings keep watch from high branches, staying hidden but ready to alert others if danger is spotted. Their insane speed means they can sound the alarm in seconds.
- **Enchanted Thorns:** Certain parts of the grove are protected by thick vines and thorns that grow suddenly when disturbed. These thorns deal 1d4 piercing damage per 5 feet moved through them unless the PCs succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.
- **Trickling Mists:** Strange Fey magic affects the mist that surrounds the den. If someone breathes it in, roll on a random effect table:
    - _(1-2)_: They become lost for 1d4 rounds, acting on their own accord and walking in random directions.
    - _(3-4)_: They feel compelled to speak in riddles and cryptic language for the next hour.
    - _(5-6)_: They see illusions of friendly faces where enemies stand, causing them to hesitate in combat, giving disadvantage on the first attack they make.

### **Feywild Quirks for the Encounter:**

1. **Time Distortion:** Time flows strangely in the area. For every hour spent in the quickling den, 6 hours pass outside in the Material Plane. The party might have consequences waiting for them when they return to town, depending on how long the encounter takes.
    
2. **Emotion Amplification:** The Feywild's magic feeds on the emotions of those within it. Those who feel anger, fear, or desperation (like the militia) have their emotions heightened to extremes. The militia members might become **reckless** and **rage-driven**, attacking without thinking about self-preservation, giving them +2 damage but imposing disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.
    
3. **Fey Wagers:** A strange, ghostly figure may appear to the players before the encounter (a Fey spirit or even an Archfey in disguise), offering a twisted wager. For example, the spirit might offer to give the party an advantage in the coming fight (a buff) in exchange for one of their memories or something precious to them.
    
4. **Living Shadows:** The shadows of creatures seem to act independently in the Feywild. During the encounter, a PCâ€™s shadow might detach from them briefly and act on its own accord (usually a minor nuisance like blocking an attack or tripping them momentarily). Alternatively, the shadows might warn the party of impending danger or betrayal.
