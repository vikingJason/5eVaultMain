The Amulet of the Eternal Seal is a magical trinket that can be used to trap the souls of the dead.

This amulet is made of a shimmering silver metal and is adorned with a glowing crystal at its center. When the crystal is activated, the amulet creates a powerful field of energy that can trap the soul of any deceased creature within a 20-foot radius.

To use the amulet, a character must hold it up to the deceased creature's body and speak a command word. The crystal will glow brightly, and the soul of the deceased will be drawn into the amulet, where it will be trapped indefinitely.

Once a soul has been trapped in the amulet, it can be released at any time by speaking a second command word. The crystal will glow again, and the soul will be released back into the world of the living.

The Amulet of the Eternal Seal can be a powerful tool for characters who need to interrogate the dead, gather information from beyond the grave, or even prevent necromancers from raising an army of undead. However, the amulet also comes with a price: the souls trapped within it can become restless and vengeful, and may try to escape or seek revenge on their captors.

Characters who use the Amulet of the Eternal Seal must be careful to use it responsibly and with respect for the dead. They should also be prepared to deal with the consequences of trapping souls, both in the mortal world and beyond.
