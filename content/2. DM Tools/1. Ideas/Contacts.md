### **What Exactly do you consider a “Contact”?**

A temporary contact or NPC would just function like an NPC, but a “Contact” is someone with a deep connection. They are almost always there and willing to help so long as the characters are connected to them or haven’t done something to piss them off.


### **Simple Contacts System for D&D 5e**

- All characters have access to an additional skill called “Contacts” that is based on their charisma attribute.
- The character’s total rank in the Contacts skill is the maximum number of permanent contacts they can have.
- A character can have proficiency or expertise in contacts, giving them more contact slots.
- Characters can fill a contacts slot with a contact they develop or come across.
- A contact cannot just be switched out without some major in game event, i.e. you get burned by your organization and lose contacts with it, you can then find or create new contacts through the game.
- Each contact you have is assigned a Name / Description, Role, and a Likes… attribute.
- Roles are specific areas the contacts can help with and define the contact’s mechanical benefit. Likes… is an attribute that just describes what the contact appreciates in case you have to woo them to get info.
    - **Optional**: The contacts skill can be rolled like a normal skill, representing a kind of Gather Information ability. (In my games I actually call it Contacts / Gather Info.

**Contact Roles**

Here are a few contacts Roles that I’ve defined, but creating a new one is quite easy and merely needs to fit the paradigms of your game.Â  Where there are parentheses, that means to define a specific area the contact is proficient in. Some roles may require multiple contact slots, or you can use multiple contact slots to give one contact multiple areas of proficiency.

- **MoneybagsÂ**  – Can back an endeavor and provide funding for an expedition or heist, expects to be paid back. Must be wooed.
- **Researcher ( )** – Grants expertise on related check to find information through research if you have proficiency, proficiency if you don’t. Can only be called on every so often.
