In Dungeons & Dragons, tainted unicorn blood can have various effects on characters, often depending on the context of the campaign and the Dungeon Master's narrative. Here are some possible effects of coming into contact with tainted unicorn blood:

1. **Corruption of Purity**: Tainted unicorn blood might corrupt a character's inherent purity and virtues. It could lead to feelings of greed, jealousy, or malevolence, making them more susceptible to darker impulses and evil influences.
    
2. **Curse of the Unseen**: Contact with tainted unicorn blood could result in an unseen curse that weakens the character's connection to the divine or the natural world. Spells or abilities reliant on celestial or nature-based powers may be affected or diminished.
    
3. **Physical Afflictions**: Tainted unicorn blood might inflict physical ailments upon the character. Their skin might turn ashen or dark, and they might experience periodic bouts of pain or weakness.
    
4. **Visions and Nightmares**: Characters exposed to tainted unicorn blood might suffer from vivid and haunting visions or nightmares. These visions could reveal dark prophecies or glimpses into malevolent forces at play.
    
5. **Disconnection from Nature**: Characters might find that they lose their ability to connect with animals and nature as they once could. Animals might shy away from them, and plants might wither in their presence.
    
6. **Spectral Manifestations**: The taint of unicorn blood could cause spectral manifestations to appear around the character. Ghostly images of unicorns or other celestial creatures might haunt them, constantly reminding them of their tainted state.
    
7. **Tainted Aura**: Characters who come into contact with the blood might emit an unnatural aura that disturbs animals and makes others uneasy. This aura could lead to mistrust or fear from those who perceive it.
    
8. **Curse of the Horn**: For those who intentionally seek the power of the unicorn, tainted blood might curse them with the appearance of a twisted or corrupted unicorn horn. This twisted horn could carry a dark magic or have unpredictable consequences.
    
9. **Alignment Shift**: In extreme cases, prolonged exposure to tainted unicorn blood might lead to a shift in the character's alignment. A once-good character might gradually lean towards chaotic or evil tendencies, influenced by the darkness in the blood.
