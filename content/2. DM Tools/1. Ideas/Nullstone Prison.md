The "Nullstone Prison" is a high-security facility located on a remote island in the middle of a vast ocean. It was built by a powerful archmage as a place to incarcerate the most dangerous magical criminals and otherworldly beings. The prison is a massive stone fortress with walls that are over 50 feet high and protected by a powerful anti-magic field that covers the entire island.

The anti-magic field is created by a network of enchanted crystals that are buried deep underground. The crystals emit a powerful energy field that nullifies all magic within a certain radius. This makes it impossible for prisoners to cast spells, use magical items, or summon creatures to aid them in their escape. The only exceptions are the warden and a select few guards who are allowed to carry specially enchanted weapons that can penetrate the anti-magic field.

The prison itself is divided into several levels, each with its own security measures and wardens. The upper levels house the most dangerous inmates, including powerful wizards, demon lords, and other extraplanar entities. These levels are heavily guarded, and prisoners are kept in individual cells that are reinforced with special anti-magic wards.

The lower levels of the prison house more mundane criminals, such as thieves and assassins. These levels are still protected by the anti-magic field, but the security measures are not as extreme as in the upper levels. Prisoners are housed in larger communal cells, but they are still closely monitored by guards and wardens.

The prison also has a large central courtyard that is used for exercise and other activities. However, even in this area, the anti-magic field prevents any kind of magical activity.

Overall, the Nullstone Prison is an almost impenetrable fortress that is virtually impossible to escape from. The anti-magic field, combined with the heavily fortified walls and multiple layers of security, make it one of the most secure prisons in the world of D&D.
