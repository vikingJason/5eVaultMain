Here’s a fleshed-out version of this touching and whimsical side quest, blending the Feywild's mystical elements with Lullaby’s personal connection to the orphan child.

### **Side Quest: "The Missing Blanket"**

---

#### **Quest Hook**

While in a small village or settlement near the edge of the Feywild, Lullaby is approached by a young orphan child, **Petal**, who tearfully asks for help. The child explains that their favorite blanket, a worn but cherished piece of fabric embroidered with stars, has gone missing. Petal confides that they can’t sleep without it because it was the last thing they had from their parents before they were lost.

The child’s plight resonates deeply with Lullaby, as Petal is also an orphan. As Lullaby learns more, it becomes clear that Petal’s blanket has been taken into the nearby **Whisperleaf Grove**, a mystical forest known for its whimsical, unpredictable magic.

---

#### **Key Details**

- **Petal’s Blanket:** This is no ordinary blanket. While it looks mundane, it is subtly infused with Fey magic—possibly due to its proximity to the Feywild. This magic radiates comfort, security, and warmth to its owner, which is why Petal treasures it so deeply.
- **The Fey Parent:** Deep within the forest, a Fey creature named **Elaria Whistlebloom**, a pixie, has been collecting small trinkets, toys, and other items to prepare for the arrival of her soon-to-be child. She mistook the blanket’s enchantment as a sign it would be a perfect gift for her own baby.

### **Exploration Phase**

The players must enter **Whisperleaf Grove** to find the blanket. The forest is alive with Feywild magic, making navigation tricky and whimsical. Along the way, they’ll encounter various obstacles:

1. **Living Trails:** The forest paths seem to change when the party looks away, leading them in circles unless they succeed on a **DC 14 Wisdom (Survival)** or **Perception** check. Failure causes them to encounter a harmless but mischievous creature, such as a prankster sprite, who might demand a small favor in exchange for directions.
    
2. **Laughing Brambles:** A patch of sentient, giggling brambles blocks the way. The brambles can be persuaded to part (DC 13 Charisma [Persuasion]) if the players entertain them with jokes or songs. They react poorly to threats, causing them to ensnare anyone who attacks (restrained, DC 12 Strength to escape).
    
3. **Pixie Trail:** A glittering trail of fairy dust eventually leads the party deeper into the forest, where they discover Elaria’s cozy, hidden hollow.

### **Confronting Elaria Whistlebloom**

**Elaria** is a small, glowing pixie with iridescent wings. She radiates a kind but fiercely protective energy, especially as she prepares for the arrival of her child. When confronted about the blanket, she explains her perspective:

- She didn’t realize the blanket was so important to someone else. To her, the warmth and comfort it radiates felt like a gift from the forest, perfect for her newborn.
- She’s reluctant to part with it unless convinced that Petal truly needs it. Her Fey nature values emotion and personal stories over logic, so players must appeal to her sense of empathy.

#### **Resolving the Conflict**

The party has several ways to resolve this encounter:

1. **Convince Elaria (Diplomacy):**
    
    - Players can explain the emotional importance of the blanket to Petal, perhaps having Lullaby share their own experiences of clinging to small comforts as an orphan. A heartfelt plea (DC 15 Charisma [Persuasion]) can sway Elaria to return the blanket willingly, possibly with an additional token of goodwill.
2. **Barter for the Blanket (Trade):**
    
    - Elaria might agree to return the blanket if the party can provide something equally comforting or meaningful for her baby. Examples:
        - An enchanted item, such as a glowing crystal or minor magical trinket.
        - A crafted gift, like a handwoven scarf or carved toy, which could require skill checks (DC 15 Dexterity [Sleight of Hand] or relevant crafting tools).
3. **Steal the Blanket (Subterfuge):**
    
    - If diplomacy fails or the players choose to act more recklessly, they could attempt to take the blanket. However, this risks angering Elaria, who will retaliate with **Fey magic** (casting spells like _Entangle_, _Tasha’s Hideous Laughter_, or _Sleep_).
4. **Shared Custody (Compromise):**
    
    - A creative party might propose a compromise where Elaria weaves a new blanket for her baby, enchanted with a portion of the magic from Petal’s blanket. This would require the players to assist with gathering materials in the forest (e.g., moonlit spider silk or dew from a magical flower).

### **Rewards and Outcomes**

Depending on how the players handle the situation, they can gain different rewards and outcomes:

1. **The Blanket Returned:** Petal is overjoyed to have their blanket back and becomes a loyal friend to Lullaby, looking up to them as a protector. Elaria may also offer a small Fey trinket as thanks for the players’ kindness.
    
    - **Reward:** Fey Trinket (roll or choose):
        - A **Pixie’s Lantern** that glows faintly in the dark.
        - A vial of **Whisperleaf Dew** that acts as a minor healing potion (restores 1d6 HP).
        - A charm granting **advantage on saving throws against being charmed** for 24 hours.
2. **Shared Custody/Trade Outcome:** If the party barters or compromises, Elaria gifts the players a small favor in gratitude. This might allow the players to call upon her help in the future or provide unique information about the Feywild.
    
    - **Reward:** A minor **Pixie Charm**, granting one use of the spell _Faerie Fire_ or _Invisibility_.
3. **If the Blanket Is Stolen:** Elaria becomes a thorn in the party’s side, potentially appearing later to exact playful or dangerous revenge. Fey creatures in the region might also mistrust the party, complicating future interactions.
