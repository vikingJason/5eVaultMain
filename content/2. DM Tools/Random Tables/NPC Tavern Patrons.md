Gustav has been a guardsman in the area for nearly 150 years, and most people know him well. Has a relaxed but careful attitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  91  | Gladiolas Doombaker- A high elf with odd magical facial brands and the look of an archmage offers succulent pastries to the party. A former Archvillain, Gladiolas was defeated by a party who used powerful divine magic to switch his focus from the arcane to the oven. He now prepares incredibly delicious breads, muffins, and other doughy goodies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  92  | Darlan the Humanâ€“a swarthy, golden-eyed man with dark hair drinks alone at the bar. With very little provocation, he will inform you he isn't a Tiefling, and that he was just born looking a little different. His grandfather was a priest of the sun god. There is no demonic line in his family, thank you very much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  93  | Curtis and Lissandra- a younger-middle aged couple are holding hands at one of the tables. He is a wizard, and she is a paladin.

|  94  | Two rather drunk clerics are performing a raucous and somewhat raunchy augury, asking about people in the room to shouts of laughter from onlookers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  95  | Palwise the Invisible Handâ€“A halfling sits on a stool, enjoying what looks like lemonade. His arms and hands are completely and permanently invisible, the result of a misspoken wish.

|  96  | A group of sopping wet adventurers come slouching in the tavern, leaving muddy footprints. It is a clear day outside. If asked, the fighter smacks the wizard upside the head and mutters about a cooling spell gone wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  97  | A man (clearly royalty or nobility in disguise) is chatting amiably with those around him, while his guard, also in disguise and looking long-suffering, sits close by. The locals can tell, but are taking it in good grace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
