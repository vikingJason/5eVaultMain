|   1  | A mysterious man sits in the corner of the bar wearing temple robes. He looks worried. If asked why, he will tell you that he saw an omen this morning that signifies the end of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

When they finish, the spare is tipped into a nearby plant, out of the window or otherwise disposed of.

|  90  | Gustav Ironboots- A grizzled Dwarf guard captain, with a kindly eye and a friendly word from half of the patrons. Gustav has been a guardsman in the area for nearly 150 years, and most people know him well. Has a relaxed but careful attitude.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  91  | Gladiolas Doombaker- A high elf with odd magical facial brands and the look of an archmage offers succulent pastries to the party. A former Archvillain, Gladiolas was defeated by a party who used powerful divine magic to switch his focus from the arcane to the oven. He now prepares incredibly delicious breads, muffins, and other doughy goodies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  92  | Darlan the Human–a swarthy, golden-eyed man with dark hair drinks alone at the bar. With very little provocation, he will inform you he isn't a Tiefling, and that he was just born looking a little different. His grandfather was a priest of the sun god. There is no demonic line in his family, thank you very much.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  93  | Curtis and Lissandra- a younger-middle aged couple are holding hands at one of the tables. He is a wizard, and she is a paladin. They have left their children with the neighbor's daughter and are having a quiet dinner together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|  94  | Two rather drunk clerics are performing a raucous and somewhat raunchy augury, asking about people in the room to shouts of laughter from onlookers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  95  | Palwise the Invisible Hand–A halfling sits on a stool, enjoying what looks like lemonade. His arms and hands are completely and permanently invisible, the result of a misspoken wish. He sometimes wears long sleeves and gloves, but not today.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  96  | A group of sopping wet adventurers come slouching in the tavern, leaving muddy footprints. It is a clear day outside. If asked, the fighter smacks the wizard upside the head and mutters about a cooling spell gone wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|  97  | A man (clearly royalty or nobility in disguise) is chatting amiably with those around him, while his guard, also in disguise and looking long-suffering, sits close by. The locals can tell, but are taking it in good grace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  98  | Nepason Burke–An Eldritch knight and half of Burke and Habbes, a famous adventuring duo from twenty years ago. Eprim Habbes is now a Lord and a General.

|  99  | A very drunk doppelganger. His disguise is slipping as he drinks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  100 | Garick Jenerick–An odd old man who approaches different parties and implores their aid. Very wealthy and rather senile, he has a gruesome 'hobby' collecting body parts from various monsters- goblin ears, rat tails, wolf pelts, etc. What he does with them no one knows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
