| I have an eye, but I can not see and I am guided only by the winds. I am strong and disasterous but in the center of me, I am calm. I live for a while but I die soon enough, and when you least expect it I am reborn. What am I? **a hurricane**                                            |     |

| Part carbon, part water, I am poison to the fishes. Many have falsely claimed my name, for I am the pause that refreshes. **soda pop**                                                                                                                                                        |     |
