| **Caravel**  | The caravel is a small highly-manoeuvrable sailing ship. The lateen sails gave it speed and the capacity for sailing windward (beating) and were used for oceanic exploration voyages.                                                                                                                                                                                             | ![[caravel.jpg]]  |
| **Longship** | Longships were a type of specialised warships. Originally invented and used for commerce, exploration, and warfare. The longship's design evolved over many centuries.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ![[longship.jpg]] |
| **Carrack**  | A carrack is a three- or four-masted ocean-going sailing ship, large enough to be stable in heavy seas, and capacious enough to carry a large cargo and the provisions needed for very long voyages.                                                                                                                                                                               | ![[carrack.jpg]]  |
| **Brig**     | A brig is a type of sailing vessel defined by its rig: two masts which are both square-rigged. Brigs were a common type of smaller merchant vessel or warship.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ![[Brig.jpg]]     |
| **Galley**   | A galley is a type of ship that is propelled mainly by oars. The galley is characterized by its long, slender hull, shallow draft, and low freeboard (clearance between sea and railing). Virtually all types of galleys had sails that could be used in favorable winds, but human effort was always the primary method of propulsion.                                            | ![[galley.jpg]]   |
| **Galleon**  | Galleons were large, multi-decked sailing ships first used as armed cargo carriers and were the principal vessels drafted for use as warships . Galleons generally carried three or more masts with a lateen fore-and-aft rig on the rear masts, were carvel built with a prominent squared off raised stern, and used square-rigged sail plans on their fore-mast and main-masts. | ![[galleon.jpg]]  |
| **Cog**      | A cog is a type of ship that were fitted with a single mast and a square-rigged single sail. They were mostly associated with seagoing trade, their flat bottoms allowed them to settle on a level in harbour, making them easier to load and unload.                                                                                                                              | ![[cog.jpg]]      |
| **Junk**     | A junk is a type of sailing ship with fully battened sails. Historically, a junk could be one of many types of small coastal or river ships, usually serving as a cargo ship, pleasure boat, or houseboat, but also ranging in size up to large ocean-going vessel.                                                                                                                | ![[junkShip.webp]]                  |
| **Trireme**  | A trireme derives its name from its three rows of oars, manned with one man per oar. As a ship it was fast and agile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | ![[trireme.jpg]]                  |
| **Frigate**  | A frigate is a type of warship built for speed and manoeuvrability. These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted guns on a single deck or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ![[frigate2.jpg]]                  |
