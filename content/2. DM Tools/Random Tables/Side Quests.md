They wake up on the ground where the inn used to be and there's no sign of any building ever being there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|   69  | Walking through town, the party suddenly gets surrounded by the city guard. A respected captain was murdered. Witnesses say they saw someone looking similar to one of the party members. Upon looking through their things, said member appears to have lost an item easily traced back to him (one half of a pair of gloves/earrings/daggers, family insignia, one of a kind necklace etc.). Sure enough, said item was found at the scene of the crime. Someone is framing them. Not necessarily a doppelganger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   70  | The party stumbles across a dead old man. Amongst his meagre belongings is a thick tome with extensive records about everything they've done right up till today, with even more detail than they themselves knew.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|   71  | The party finds various dead animals with missing pieces, almost torn and shred. As they approach the heart of the forest the number of dead creatures increases. Upon investigation they find out it's the guardian spirit of the forest who has been corrupted and it's confused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   72  | A flyer appears in the sacks of each party member. A mid level demon has opened a store and invites all those with ambitions to visit to make deals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|   73  | A rumor reaches the party's ears of a group of brigands hiding out in the woods. They have a code that is the reverse of Robin Hood and his Merry Men: Steal from the poor, and give to the rich. None of the local nobles seem interested in the pillaged goods of their subjects, and are constantly giving back the loot they keep finding on their doorsteps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   74  | The local apothecary is desperate due to the sudden absence of all the local medicinal plants in the area. All the groves and clearings appear to have been picked clean, and even the owner's secret garden is now empty. She had told no one of her hidden garden, and so has no idea who or what could have taken all of the plants in the brief period of time between her most recent check and her previous one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|   75  | A human peasant and a member of the fey came across each other in the woods and, over the course of multiple moonlit encounters, fell deeply in love. The peasant's family has a deep-rooted fear of the fey, and is actively trying to put a stop to the pair's relationship. The family is even more fearful that the peasant will leave for the Feywild and never return, and goes to the party to convince them to help break the two lovers up. The human is in love with the Fey's otherworldly allure and sharp wit; talking to them makes the peasant feel alive in a way that they've never felt before. The Fey was originally only interested in the concept of a secretive human lover, but eventually came to love the peasant's dedication to their relationship despite the risk of alienating other loved ones. |

There are fourteen, all with a silly grin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   77  | While at the blacksmith to repair your armour, you overhear the blacksmith explaining to his apprentice to not stray off to the hills to see his new sweetheart because he heard from the baker's cousin's stepmother that there are kobolds about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|   78  | While waiting patiently for your turn to see the Bishop, you get your ear bent by some local shopkeeper about how the town council is a bunch of idiots, and how they simply wasted all that money on getting 13 gargoyle statues erected on the town hall.

|  45  | Deal of a lifetime! I'm willing to trade a lovely tin pot, painted with cornflowers and lilies (and showing a few holes, true, but that's a plus, for you can add a few more and look at that, you've got a colander) for a cart. The cart needn't be big, can even be tiny, in fact, just so that two, or better four, people could fit in it, with ample room for bags and sacks, if possible. Could be old, long as it rides well and has new wheels, and strong axles, so actually probably nothing made longer than a year or two ago would do.

Must interview.: Despite the suspicious wording, the job is treating people from discriminated-against ancestries or with embarrassing deformities that have been persecuted, passed over, or financially exploited by other healing organizations. The pay is low, but you make solid allegiances. Word of your kindness spreads among the hidden downtrodden and you may find welcome far away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  70  | Sales assistant wanted. Incredible pay!: It's a multi-level marketing job. The job poster gives you a sales talk about their wonderful liniments and gizmos. They do work, but they are overpriced. You have to make a bulk purchase of the items and then try to resell them for a profit. You are unlikely to find the buyers needed to turn a profit and are stuck with too much stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|  72  | Do you think you know your gems? A grand test awaits at Nappe and Klippe's Emporium. Only those who truly appreciate mines and minerals should apply! A local jeweler's outfit acquired a large stock of specialty mineral samples and gems from a flash sale of unclaimed shipments. They need them identified but want someone, preferentially a dwarf, who isn't going to undersell them. The first part of the job is a basic knowledge test and then they move onto the unusual samples.

|  75  | Help recovering property! This is your local bard Razzle, and if you've seen me lately you know that I haven't quite been myself. The truth is I lost my prize peacock feather hat in a wager at the Lusty Mermaid two days ago. The man who won it from me said I could pay him back for the value of the hat, but when I went to the inn he was staying at I found he skipped town without even paying his tab! (And I found out he cheated at that game of cards by the by) Please, I need a skilled ranger or another who is good at tracking to get back my hat! I'll pay you 4,000 gold to go with me to get it, and I'm willing increase the price to 5,000 if our quarry proves elusive. |
