# Guildhalls: Initiations
*Source: Raging Swan Press* 

Guilds do far more than serve as a meeting place for idle talk. Their schemes can be grand and sometimes treacherous. Even joining a guild can be a dangerous endeavour. Use these tables to add adventure and mystery to a guild.

**Benefits:** Once gained, membership comes with several benefits. The starting attitude for a fellow guild member is generally one step more favourable than normal. Guild members generally offer a 10% discount on their goods or services to other members and have contracts set up to offer the same discount on merchandise that is common to their profession. See "[amenities](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/guildhalls-amenities-rsp.md)" for more benefits a guild may provide. 

**Dues:** Guilds generally also require something in return of its members. It's generally not more than a few silver a month in membership dues and being kept apprised of information relevant to the guild's interest. Adventuring members are generally excused from making monthly visits to pay dues and in return are expected to take up the occasional task for the guild leaders. 

**Initiations:** What a commoner or even an adventuring hero needs to do to join the guild. Many guilds have several levels of initiation, with primary membership being easy but not granting full benefits
