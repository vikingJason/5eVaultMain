**Feywild Weather**

`dice: [](feywild-weather-dod.md#^feywild-weather)`

| dice: d8 | Weather Effect |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Flower blossoms rain from a sky filled with sparkling, pastel-colored clouds. |
| 2 | A grand fairy drama plays in the sky as a stylistically rendered illusion or a swirling aurora. |
| 3 | It rains tiny fruit tarts. They fall slowly and disappear just before they hit the ground. If caught from the air and eaten, they're delicious. |
| 4 | Fog rolls in and plays harmless tricks on the characters, giving them fog mustaches, fog eyebrows, and fog wigs of many stylesâ€”perhaps even fog cloaks or fog companions. |
| 5 | Snow begins to fall, and the flakes grow bigger over time. Flakes as big as dinner plates, wagon wheels, and even a waterwheel fall, but they're light as a feather. |
| 6 | The sky fills with iridescent bubbles that lazily fall to the ground. Giggling pixie children chase and pop the bubbles but turn [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and flee if spoken to or approached. |
| 7 | A silvery rain lifts the spirits and brings a song to each heart that it touches. |
| 8 | A howling wind blows through the party, and each party member must roll a `d8`. Anyone who rolls an 8 has a trinket or some other tiny, nonmagical item (such as a coin) stolen from them by weather spirits. |
