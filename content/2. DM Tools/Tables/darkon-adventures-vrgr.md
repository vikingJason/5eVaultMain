|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The party learns how to destroy the Heart of the Abyss, a relic held by the Order of the Guardians and hunted by a demon called the Whistling Fiend. |
| 2 | The [night hag](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) Styrix has created a device called the Rift Spanner that she plans to use to escape the Domains of Dread. She just needs to transform a few hundred innocents into larvae to power it. |
| 3 | A ship captain offers to take the characters away from Darkon, but only after they deliver a trunk full of alchemical supplies to Madame Eris at her family estate. |
| 4 | Merchants hire the party as protection from the pirate ship Bountiful. Captain Damon Skragg raids not for loot, but for flesh to feed his [ghoul](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) crew. |
| 5 | Researchers from the Brautslava Institute require assistants to aid in investigations into fields such as necrolinguistics and temporal archaeozoology. |
| 6 | Murders plague the wealthy families of Redleaf Lake. Locals seek aid from the characters, unaware the bitter dowager Damita Adler exacts a generations-old revenge from her dilapidated home. |
