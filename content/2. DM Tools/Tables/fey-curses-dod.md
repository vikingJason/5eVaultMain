**Fey Curses**

`dice: [](fey-curses-dod.md#^fey-curses)`

| dice: d8 | Curse |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Your ears are magically replaced by a pair of soft, fuzzy donkey ears. Moreover, when you try to speak, you instead bray. |
| 2 | You gain `1d3` levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). Until the curse ends, these levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) can't be removed. |
| 3 | Spells can't restore hit points to you. |
| 4 | The sound of pixie laughter fills your head while you are awake, drowning out all other sounds. |
| 5 | Anything you try to pick up or hold in your hands slips through your fingers. |
| 6 | Moonlight burns your flesh. You take `1d10` radiant damage when you start your turn in moonlight. |
| 7 | You are magically transformed into an animated wooden doll that looks like you. Your statistics are the same, but you are a Construct with vulnerability to fire damage, and you don't require air, food, or drink. Items worn or carried by you are unaffected. |
| 8 | Whenever you tell a lie, you lose the ability to speak for `1d8` hours. |
