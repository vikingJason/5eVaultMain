**Archfey Obsession**

`dice: [](obsessions-archfey-obsession-dod.md#^archfey-obsession)`

| dice: d8 | Obsession |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Beauty.** The archfey does everything in their power to rid their domain of that which they consider ugly. What they consider beautiful is not always clear, however. |
| 2 | **Color.** This archfey is obsessed with a particular color and puts their subjects to work making sure the archfey's favorite color is predominant. Wearing another color in the domain could be seen as laughable, obnoxious, or downright rude. |
| 3 | **Etiquette.** The rules in the archfey's domain change as they learn about some new custom that is popular in the Summer Court. The archfey requires all creatures in their domain to respect the new rules of etiquette. |
| 4 | **Magic.** Magic in all its forms fascinates the archfey. They collect magic items and spellbooks, and they enjoy seeing demonstrations of magic from visitors. |
| 5 | Material **Plane.** The archfey is obsessed with creatures and objects from the Material Plane. There is a scent, an energy, and a uniqueness to them that fascinates the archfey. |
| 6 | **Monsters.** The archfey has a menagerie of monsters and is obsessed with finding marvelous new creatures to add to its collection. |
| 7 | Rule of **Three.** The archfey is obsessed with the Rule of Three. They look for patterns, deeper meanings, and ill omens in things that occur in threes. The archfey's obsession is reflected throughout their domain, where things seem to naturally come in threes. |
| 8 | **Stories.** The archfey wants nothing more than to listen to stories told by creatures from faraway places. They love to gather lore so they can build their own internal world of imagination or transform their domain with ideas from other worlds. Their lair is festooned with books, which give the archfey inspiration. |
