**Ending the Curse**

`dice: [](fey-curses-ending-the-curse-dod.md#^ending-the-curse)`

| dice: d12 | Ending the Curse |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | You must carve your name into a tree, whereupon the tree inherits the curse's magic and dies. |
| 2 | You must drink the blood of a pixie or sprite while basking in moonlight. |
| 3 | You must speak the true name of the creature that cursed you three times in a row. |
| 4 | While standing in sunlight on an arched bridge over running water, you must beg the Summer Queen for her "fair blessing." |
| 5 | After filling your pockets with fool's gold, you must flap your arms and quack like a duck. |
| 6 | You must bury an executioner's hood (a blackcapped mushroom found in the Feywild) in the earth and pour goat's milk over it while whistling. |
| 7 | You must be bitten by a faerie dragon. (It's possible any faerie dragon might do, or the faerie dragon might have to be of a particular color.) |
| 8 | You must leave a bouquet of eight black roses at the place where you were cursed, or you must give the bouquet to the creature that cursed you. |
| 9 | You must persuade a centaur to carry you on its back for eight miles. Before the centaur will do this willingly, it might demand a gift or service in exchange, or the completion of a quest. |
| 10 | You must obtain leaves or pinecones from three different species of treants and burn them in a campfire under a full moon while singing a particular campfire song. |
| 11 | You must bake a small cake and leave it on the doorstep of a forest gnome's abode. Only when the gnome eats the whole cake does your curse end. |
| 12 | You must persuade another creature to willingly take your name. If it does so, it inherits your curse, whereupon you are nameless and must choose a new name for yourself. |
