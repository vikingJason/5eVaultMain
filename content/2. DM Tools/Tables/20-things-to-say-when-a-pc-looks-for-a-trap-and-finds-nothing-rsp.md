# 20 Things to Say When a PC Looks for a Trap and Finds Nothing
*Source: Raging Swan Press* 

layers are a paranoid bunch. The only thing they hate more than finding a trap is not finding a trap when they are certain one lurks nearby!

Use the table below, when a PC makes a Perception check and finds nothing, but remember to modify the entries to take into account the dungeon environment. For example, if a dungeon has floorboards or worked stone walls you'll have to do some minor work on several of the description below. Read:

**You don't find anything out of the ordinary, but...**

| dice: d20 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The floor doesn't seem completely flat. Several parts are slightly higher than the surrounding areas. |
| 2 | Dust on the floor is thicker in some places than others |
| 3 | A gentle breeze caresses your face. You can't determine its source. |
| 4 | The mortar in the walls is old and crumbling. In some places, it has completely disintegrated leaving gaps between the bricks. |
| 5 | The floor at one point seems to be slightly concave and the stones look slightly damp. |
| 6 | Your (torch, lantern or other) light casts strange shadows on the walls as if they are not as flat as they first appeared. |
| 7 | The area seems slightly colder than you'd expect. |
| 8 | The area seems slightly warmer than you'd expect. |
| 9 | There is a faint, acrid smell in the air. |
| 10 | You are pretty certain you heard the faint grinding or groaning of stone on stone. |
| 11 | The air is perfectly still—it's as if the dungeon itself is holding its breath...waiting for you to make a mistake. |
| 12 | The area seems safe, but for a moment you thought you heard a faint clicking sound. |
| 13 | The ceiling looks a little odd. Perhaps it's not built properly, but you swear its sloping down toward one side of the room. |
| 14 | There's a fair amount of stone dust and small pieces of stone lying against one wall. |
| 15 | The faint smell of smoke hangs in the air. |
| 16 | Several sections of the walls have soot stains reminiscent of that left by torches set in sconces. However, there are no sconces present anywhere in the room. |
| 17 | Scratches on the floor show something large and heavy was dragged through here. However, the scratches stop roughly halfway across the area. |
| 18 | In three spots, water drips from the ceiling onto the floor. None of the resultant puddles seem very large suggesting the water is draining away somehow. |
| 19 | Faint growths of mould on the (floor, wall or ceiling) hint at an organised pattern of sorts unlikely to occur in nature. (The pattern could be suggestive of a hidden portal, trapdoor, pit or sigil of arcane of divine nature). |
| 20 | The proportions of the whole chamber just look wrong. Some pieces of architecture—protrusions and niches—seem to serve no purpose whatsoever and the ceiling seems suspiciously low. |
