**I'Cath Adventures**

`dice: [](icath-adventures-vrgr.md#^icath-adventures)`

| dice: d10 | Adventure |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | A desperate local needs medicine for a sick spouse, but the only merchant in Gwai-Huit Center with the necessary herbs demands fresh fruit from the Gemstone Gardens. The local entreats the characters to infiltrate the [jiangshi](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/jiangshi-vrgr.md)-haunted park (see "chapter 5"). |
| 2 | A child has gone missing on the streets of I'Cath. The child's parents plead with the characters to find the youngster before dusk. |
| 3 | A [spy](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md) known as a criminal in I'Cath's dream city is imprisoned and tormented every time he falls asleep. He begs for the characters' aid to help keep him awake. |
| 4 | A group of [bandits](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) waylay anyone who passes through their territory, demanding fresh meat for passage. Trapped locals seek help in moving through the gang's territory. |
| 5 | A melancholy elf is unable to enter Tsien Chiang's dream to join his family. He entreats the characters to help him find a way. |
| 6 | A [jiangshi](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/jiangshi-vrgr.md) approaches the characters and asks them to locate one or more of her lost family members within the dream city. She's worried about what's become of her family—their bodies should be in the city, but she's lost track of them. |
| 7 | A family in the Mansions made offerings of food and remembrances to placate a hungry [ghost](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghost.md). This has attracted dozens of other ghosts. The family seeks help placating the undead mouths they can't feed. |
| 8 | Tsien Chiang's library in the Palace of Bones holds secrets about the border between dreams and reality. The characters must infiltrate the palace, find the information they need, and escape before Tsien Chiang returns at dawn. |
| 9 | A desperate [veteran](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) wakes from the dream and attempts to set I'Cath on fire, believing it's better for everything to burn than to live a lie. The characters must choose how to contend with the murderous arsonist. |
| 10 | All but one of Tsien Chiang's daughters have gone missing—and the remaining daughter is either Tsien Seu-Mei or Tsien Lei-An, neither of whom can speak. This daughter crosses the party's path and silently begs for help. |
