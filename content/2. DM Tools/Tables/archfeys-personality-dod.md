**Archfey's Personality**

`dice: [](archfeys-personality-dod.md#^archfeys-personality)`

| dice: d8 | Personality |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Benevolent.** The archfey welcomes all into their domain and does everything in their power to assist those who come to them in true friendship or grave need. |
| 2 | **Covetous.** The archfey hoards things they consider valuable and uses spies to find more of what they covet. The archfey never leaves their lair for fear that their hoard might be plundered. |
| 3 | **Imperious.** The archfey surrounds themself with a court of sycophants and expects visitors to grovel before them. Their mercy is rare, and their superiority complex is legendary. |
| 4 | **Madcap.** The archfey loves to sing, dance, drink, wear silly masks, do cartwheels, and throw parties where everyone is free to cavort and revel how they wish. |
| 5 | **Mercurial.** The archfey has two personalities (choose two other personalities from this table). They shift back and forth between these personalities at certain times or when certain conditions are met. |
| 6 | **Mischievous.** The archfey is a trickster who likes to confound and frustrate visitors to their domain and who surrounds themself with sly creatures such as boggles, pixies, foxes, magpies, and crows. |
| 7 | **Reclusive.** The archfey prefers to be left alone and seldom, if ever, leaves their domain. They might adopt disguises or turn [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) when they travel, and they might use magic to conceal their lair. |
| 8 | **Wild.** The archfey has the demeanor of a wild animal and shuns the trappings of society. |
