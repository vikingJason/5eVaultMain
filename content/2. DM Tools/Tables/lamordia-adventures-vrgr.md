| 1 | Sapient lab animals escape Ludendorf University and need help finding a new home. One, however, is eager to improve upon its form and the forms of its fellows. |
| 2 | Medical student Emil Bollenbach strives to craft revolutionary [flesh golems](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/flesh-golem.md), such as ones made entirely of doppelgangers or beholders. His patrons enlist the party to aid his research. |
| 3 | A murderous, jaundiced whale is hunting Ludendorf's ships. The superstitious Captain Furschter of the city's navy asks the party to learn why by seeking Winter's Mouth, a crack in the ice where the sea supposedly whispers its secrets. |
| 4 | Three brilliant Ludendorf University students compete to become Dr. Mordenheim's new assistant. Each seeks the party's assistance in ensuring they're chosen for the opportunity. |
| 5 | A wave of warped monstrosities is preparing to assault Neufurchtenburg. The metallurgists at the Giesbrecht Automatic Armaments company have created a new weapon or vehicle that could save the town, but they need someone to test it. |
| 6 | Ruprekt Schaller stood to inherit his dying father's factory in Ludendorf. Instead, Udo Schaller paid assassins to murder his son and had his brain transplanted into Ruprekt's young body, with the help of Dr. Mordenheim. Udo's daughter and sole surviving heir, Varissa Schaller, wants to avenge her brother's murder and begs the party to help destroy her father. |
| 7 | Prospectors seeking rare gas pockets discover numerous well-preserved bog mummies dating back to Lamordia's ancient druidic peoples. They seek help when the mummies vanish and undead animals begin terrorizing their camp. |
| 8 | Baron von Aubrecker writes to the party, asking them to recover the body of a "relative" from the Haifisch, a shipwreck impaled on a spire of ice. |
| 9 | The Sleeping Beast is experiencing an increasing number of earthquakes. The overseers of the Pulstein Mine call for aid, believing that strange creatures are causing the quakes to steal the "marrowstone" they're mining. |
| 10 | Scholars at Ludendorf University learn of the Unbreakable Heart and claim a monster stole it. The characters and dozens of other hunters are sent to the Isles of Agony to recover the device. |
