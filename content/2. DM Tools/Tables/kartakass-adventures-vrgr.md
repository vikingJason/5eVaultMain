|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters arrive in Kartakass and immediately meet a friendly local: Harkon Lukas. |
| 2 | A foe carries an invitation to Harmonia's Crystal Club. If the characters visit, they find themselves the only non-lycanthropes in the crowd. |
| 3 | A set dresser in Medria used "tamed"[mimics](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic.md) during a stage production. Now the audience is trapped inside a theater overrun by the monsters. |
| 4 | The party investigates a murder in Emherst. The victim is an actor who played a character murdered daily in the ongoing immersive play. |
| 5 | Akriel Lukas hires the party to "borrow" her father's violin so she can accurately model her own violin, Sundered Heart, from it. |
| 6 | A scholar named Radaga seeks the characters' aid in recovering a mysterious relic—an ancient crown—from a skeleton-haunted canyon in the Martello Hills. |
| 7 | The party is invited to participate in a fighting tournament in the goblin-overrun hills known as the Catacombs. Upon arriving, they find that [goblins](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) organized the event under the oversight of the flamboyant [gladiator](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) Nym Pymplee. |
| 8 | A brewer in Harmonia hires the party to deliver a cart of meekulbrau—a local berry wine that soothes the throat and improves vocal performances. A band of thieves hijacked the last two deliveries, and the brewer wants to make sure this latest delivery reaches its buyer, Harkon Lukas. |
