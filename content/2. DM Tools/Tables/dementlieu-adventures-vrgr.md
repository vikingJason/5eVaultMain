|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A shrieky soprano is starring in the new production at the Port-a-Lucine Opera House. Jealous divas hire the party to figure out what magic she used to bewitch her way into a role. |
| 2 | A Phlegethan Hospital patient contacts the party, claiming to be the rightful Duke d'Honaire. He has a preternatural ability to bend others to his will. |
| 3 | The party runs afoul of the city watch and learns that their captain has been replaced by a devil who's transforming them into a brutal force. |
| 4 | People are being replaced by lifelike constructs, while the originals are held captive in the cellar beneath Alexandre du Cire's House of Wax. A party member is the next target. |
| 5 | A crusader hunting the Red Death is murdered. The culprit isn't the Red Death, but the family of a recent victim, who don't want the victim's poverty and lies to come to light. |
| 6 | A woman claiming to be Duchess Saidra's stepsister arrives in town and makes discreet inquiries about how to best reveal the horrible truth about the duchess: that she is a lowborn fraud. |
