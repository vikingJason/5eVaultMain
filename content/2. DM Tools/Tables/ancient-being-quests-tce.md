**Ancient Being Quests**

`dice: [](ancient-being-quests-tce.md#^ancient-being-quests)`

| dice: d6 | Quest |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Rescue**. A wayward agent went missing while gathering information or materials. You must discover their fate and recover them and their findings. |
| 2 | **Sabotage**. You must destroy an aspect of a rival's organization, either assassinating a key minion or destroying a critical object. |
| 3 | **Artifice**. Your specialized skills are instrumental to assembling components for a powerful magic ritual or object. |
| 4 | **Treachery**. A high-profile minion of another powerful figure is in a position to betray their master, to the benefit of your patron. You must convince them to defect to your organization or extract them from now-hostile territory. |
| 5 | **Culling**. A respected agent of your patron (possibly an ally or a mentor for your group) has been compromised. Perhaps they are defecting to a rival, attempting to seize the ancient being's power. Whatever the case, you must catch them to end their threat. |
| 6 | **Astral Heist**. A powerful rival of your patron stores their secrets in a mind vault on the Astral Plane. That means they can't be tricked or coerced into revealing anything, nor can their thoughts be read. You must find the vault and travel through the rival's deadly memories to find the knowledge your patron desires. |
