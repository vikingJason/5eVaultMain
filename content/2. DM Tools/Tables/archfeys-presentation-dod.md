| dice: d8 | Presentation |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Adorable.** The archfey has taken on the form of something adorable, such as an otter, a fawn, a sugar glider, a wombat, or a beautiful butterfly. |
| 2 | **Ancient.** This archfey appears to be eons old. They might have gnarled skin like teakwood and long, gray hair that looks like elaborate lacework. |
| 3 | **Bizarre.** This archfey looks like something from the realm of dreams. They could take on the appearance of a scintillating ball of light, a floating mask, or a whispering shadow. |
| 4 | **Floral.** Flowers bloom from the archfey's fingertips, and their skin is covered in petals. Their body might have thorns, or they could have vine-like hair covered in sweet-smelling blossoms. |
| 5 | **Fluid.** The archfey can change body type or transform from one creature into another. |
| 6 | **Iridescent.** The archfey floats off the ground and gazes about with glowing eyes, their body surrounded by a nimbus of light and their skin sparkling like sunlight on water. |
| 7 | **Metallic.** The archfey appears to be made of metal. Their face is an exquisitely crafted mask of mithral, silver, or gold, and their body is made of finely tooled metal etched with organic designs or cryptic symbols. |
| 8 | **Monstrous.** This archfey has a monstrous form. For example, they might resemble an enormous spider, a hydra whose heads look like oversized elf heads with fangs, or any other horrific form you can imagine. |
