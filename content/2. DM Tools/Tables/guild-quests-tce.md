**Guild Quests**

`dice: [](guild-quests-tce.md#^guild-quests)`

| dice: d6 | Quest |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Deliver Goods**. You need to deliver an order to an important customer or partner of the guild. The delivery must arrive by a critical deadlineâ€”regardless of who or what tries to stop you. |
| 2 | **Acquire Materials**. Your guild requires materials that are rare and difficult to procure, either for a guild project or for a paying client. Your group must gather the missing components from a dangerous location or a recalcitrant owner while outpacing a rival to the prize. |
| 3 | **Eliminate a Rival**. A competitor has humiliated the guild one too many times, and it's time for that to stop. Your group is charged with assuring the rival never darkens the guild's reputation again. Can you trick them into permanent disgrace, or must you resort to more direct methods? |
| 4 | **The Masterpiece**. An exquisite work of art for an influential client, either created by your guild or acquired through agents, has gone missing. You must track down its whereabouts and secure it before time runs out and the guild suffers a penalty. |
| 5 | **The Collector**. Your guild is tasked to create or acquire something wondrous for a wealthy but secretive client's collection. Guild members who previously failed to fulfill this assignment ended up missing. The collector promises to return your comrades if you provide what the collector seeks, but if you fail, you'll become part of the collection. |
| 6 | **The Bill Comes Due**. Your guild master achieved their vaunted position by means of an otherworldly bargain. That price has come due, and they are desperate to avoid paying. You must defeat whatever's coming to collect the master's debt or find another acceptable payment. |
