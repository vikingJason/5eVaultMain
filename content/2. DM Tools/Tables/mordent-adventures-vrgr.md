| dice: d8 | Adventure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | An alchemist discovers a way to "burn" spirits to provide fuel for magical fire. Several spirits seek the party's aid in preventing their second death. |
| 2 | A [noble](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) seeks help as an undead ancestor tries to prevent the [noble](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)'s marriage to an "unsuitable" partner. |
| 3 | The spirits of two lovers whose families prevented their union begin exacting revenge on the living. |
| 4 | A pair of rival fiends, Athos and Diche, break loose from idols in the collection at Heather House. Members of the Weathermay family call for aid. |
| 5 | The citizens of the village of Crawford spread tales of a gigantic [raven](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/raven.md). Sheriff Perkins hires the characters to hunt down the creature, which is actually a [wereraven](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/wereraven-vrgr.md) (see "chapter 5") protecting the community from a greater threat. |
| 6 | A curse has afflicted Westcote Manor for a hundred years. The surrounding bog encroaches on the house, and howling bog hounds draw ever closer to the estate's beleaguered lord. |
| 7 | The baronet of a small estate is forced to commit increasingly heinous crimes each day or face unspeakable torment at the hands of his ghostly ancestors, who suffered under the same curse. |
| 8 | Someone has rebuilt the infamous Apparatus and is using it to transpose vicious souls into the bodies of mild-mannered citizens of Mordentshire. |
