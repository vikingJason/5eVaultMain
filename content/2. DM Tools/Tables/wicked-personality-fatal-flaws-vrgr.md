| dice: d10 | Flaw |
|-----------|------|
| 1 | Once someone questions me, I won't stop until I befriend them and then betray them. |
| 2 | Others' concerns bore me, and I would rather have my lessers handle everything possible. |
| 3 | I am always right, and anyone who doesn't agree with me is cut out of my life. |
| 4 | When someone loves me, I will do anything for them, no matter whom they hurt. |
| 5 | I've given up resisting my habits and indulge myself whenever possible. |
| 6 | I would rather be righteously angry at problems than solve them. |
| 7 | I assume everyone is lying to me, even my most trusted allies, and constantly test their loyalty. |
| 8 | I don't know love, only domineering obsession, and I chain objects of my affection to pedestals. |
| 9 | When I see something priceless or rare, I sacrifice all of my beliefs and loyalties to possess it. |
| 10 | I'm distrustful of anyone who seems pure of heart and will prove to all their admirers how secretly ugly they are. |
