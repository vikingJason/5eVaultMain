| 1 | A strange trail of toadstools leads off the beaten path into the nearby woods. |
| 2 | A pixie beckons you to follow her, promising you a sight beyond your wildest dreams. |
| 3 | A man stumbles from the forest. He doesn't speak, but his arms are full of delicious-looking fruit. |
| 4 | The party hears chattering voices and the music of panpipes coming from a secluded area. |
| 5 | In the distance, the party sees a descending dragon pulling a caravan of wagons. |
| 6 | A dragon's gentle voice calls out to the characters in their dreams, giving them directions to the market but no further details. |
