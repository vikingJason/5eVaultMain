**Weird Magic Effects**

`dice: [](weird-magic-effects-dod.md#^weird-magic-effects)`

| dice: d8 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Time visibly moves more quickly outside the region than inside it. For every minute the party spends inside the region, one hour passes outside the region. |
| 2 | Flowers not only are abundant in the region but also have faces and limited sentience, allowing them to communicate with creatures in the Elvish and Sylvan tongues. They know what has transpired in the region within the past day and happilyshare this information. |
| 3 | Each character in the region gains the benefit of a [barkskin](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/barkskin.md) spell that lasts for 8 hours. |
| 4 | Each character who spends 1 hour in the region undergoes a magical transformation, gaining fur, a tail, and large ears reminiscent of a donkey's, goat's, or llama's. This effect ends on a character `3d8` hours after the character leaves the region. Any magic that ends a curse also restores the character's normal appearance. |
| 5 | Harmless fireflies gather and flit around one character in the region, sharing that character's space for 1 hour. The fireflies generate bright light out to a range of 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet. While surrounded by the fireflies, the character feels a profound sense of purpose and gains the benefit of the [bless](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/bless.md) spell. |
| 6 | Creatures in the region can't leave it and find themselves covering the same ground over and over. By the time they realize this, `3d8` hours have passed, during which they have made no progress in their effort to leave. The effect then ends. |
| 7 | One character in the region sees a wide, grinning mouth that floats in midair, 10 feet away from them. No other creature can see the grinning mouth. In a language the character understands, the mouth says, "I'll answer three questions you put to me. Noes and yesses, I promise thee." The character can ask it three questions as if using the [commune](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/commune.md) spell. |
| 8 | One character in the region triggers a wild magic effect that is determined by rolling on the [Wild Magic Surge](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in the "Sorcerer" section of the Player's Handbook. If the effect duplicates a spell, the character's spellcasting ability for that spell is Charisma. |
