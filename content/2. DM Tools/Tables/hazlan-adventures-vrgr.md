**Hazlan Adventures**

`dice: [](hazlan-adventures-vrgr.md#^hazlan-adventures)`

| dice: d10 | Adventure |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Hazlik's apprentice Eleni charmed the ancient albino [purple worm](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) Gravedrinker, using it as a weapon against any who oppose her master. When the worm breaks free of her control, Eleni seeks aid with recapturing it before Hazlik finds out. |
| 2 | Castoff magical creations litter the dry lake bed called Obsession's End. A sapient war machine or an [iron golem](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) escapes the midden and asks the party to help it find a way to live an ordinary life. |
| 3 | Innumerable [gremishkas](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/gremishka-vrgr.md) (see "chapter 5") collect in caves along what's known as the Gnawing Path. The creatures plot to overwhelm Sly-Var and will pass through Toyalis in the process. Members of both communities request exterminators. |
| 4 | A cult forms around the Philosopher's Egg, an eight-story citrine egg perched atop a mesa in the region called Seething. The cultists hunt for someone who has never been touched by magic to release the unborn antimagic entity within. |
| 5 | One of Hazlik's apprentices sends multiple groups to capture a **star spawn emissary** (see "chapter 5") that emerged from a meteor in Moonstone Valley. But the shape-shifter disappears, slipping in among its would-be captors. |
| 6 | An apprentice of Hazlik yearns to explore the bottomless pit known as Gluttonkettle. He needs a test crew for a vehicle he's devised to traverse impossible distances. |
| 7 | A magically talented commoner is kidnapped and forced to become a wizard's apprentice. Their family hires the characters to retrieve them, but the kidnappee has quickly adjusted to the decadent life of an amoral wizard. |
| 8 | The moon over Hazlan shatters and plummets toward the ground. Whether caused by a mighty spell gone awry or a domain-spanning illusion, the sight throws Toyalis into chaos. Residents demand that the characters help them flee the disaster. |
| 9 | One of Hazlik's apprentices needs agents to search for a suspected fountain of youth said to have formed among the innumerable magical toxins polluting the swamp known as the Brew. |
| 10 | Hazlik knows his domain's days are numbered. He attempts to use the characters to recreate the living portal that first brought him to Hazlan, either as its creators or its raw materials. |
