|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A noble asks the characters to protect their sibling from a mysterious assassin. The killer is Nostalia Romaine, whose blood was replaced with poison by Ivana Boritsi. |
| 2 | A scholar requests aid in gaining access to Scholomance. This institution is Borca's elite school of magic and also home to the Rainmaker Society, which is said to control Borcan politics. |
| 3 | A young noble befriends the characters and introduces them to the fabulously amoral Levkarest club scene. By the night's end, a character is accused of murder. |
| 4 | Half the village of Leoni is arrested by the erinyes-masked Judge Ranziska and marched before Sturben's Faceless Court. The remaining villagers beseech the party to defend their families in court. |
| 5 | The eligible noble Vladimir Nobriskov hosts a contest for his affections. Participants turn up murdered, victims of Nobriskov's lycanthropic hunger. |
| 6 | A book-collecting noble seeks the party's help in finding a rare text called The Revelations of the Prince of Twilight, a tome said to teach the reader to tap into the hidden power of their shadow. |
| 7 | The Ocrotire family offers a sizable bounty for anyone who can capture the Lake Balaur Beast, which has escaped from the estate's oceanarium. |
| 8 | Members of the Ulmist Inquisition accuse the characters of crimes they haven't yet committed. They relent only if the characters undertake a mission against the [priests of Osybus](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/priest-of-osybus-vrgr.md) (see "chapter 5"). |
