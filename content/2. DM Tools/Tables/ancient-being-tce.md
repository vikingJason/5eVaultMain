**Ancient Being**

`dice: [](ancient-being-tce.md#^ancient-being)`

| dice: d6 | Ancient Being |
|----------|---------------|
| 1 | **Elder Dragon**. An ancient dragon seeks knowledge or power. It wishes to gather greater wealth for its hoard, its ambitions expanding in its advancing years. |
| 2 | **Lich**. An undead spellcaster of immense power employs your group. Its interests are strangely diverse and seemingly benign. Perhaps it's not as evil as conventional adventuring wisdom suggests? |
| 3 | **Bound Fiend**. This fiend is bound to a location, either in its true form or as a possessing spirit. Whether trapped in an unbreakable circle of binding sigils or sealed as a spirit within a gigantic statue, the fiend's influence drives your group. |
| 4 | **Guardian Celestial**. An angel or another powerful celestial takes an interest in a specific region of the Material Plane. It cultivates a network of mortal informants and agents to serve its agenda. |
| 5 | **The Endless**. This person has lived many lifetimes because they can't dieâ€”at least not permanently. No matter the cause of their demise, they return. To all appearances, they are alive and mortal, but they control the amassed resources of an immortal. |
| 6 | **Primal Manifestation**. Its existence defies mortal understanding; the being simply is. It could be a primordial force of nature awakened to self-awareness that now inhabits the landscape or an alien intellect that whispers through proxies, omens, and idols. |
