**Fey Crossings**

`dice: [](coming-and-going-fey-crossings-dod.md#^fey-crossings)`

| dice: d8 | Fey Crossing |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Altar.** This stone altar might be found atop a lonely plateau, behind a waterfall, inside a cave, or in some other remote location. When certain stars align and the proper ritual is performed, the fey crossing appears as a portal above the altar. |
| 2 | **Crystal Cave.** This cave is filled with natural crystalline formations and resembles a glittering cathedral. When moonlight shines into the cave at night, it causes a shimmering pool or spring in the center of the cave to transform into a fey crossing. |
| 3 | **Hollow Tree.** The fey crossing lies within the hollow interior of an enormous tree. The crossing is open to anyone who carries a leaf or acorn from the tree. |
| 4 | **Maze.** The fey crossing lies at the center of a maze that might change configuration from time to time. To use the crossing, one must walk or run from the maze's entrance to its center. Creatures who circumvent the maze using magic or flight find themselves unable to use the crossing. |
| 5 | **Mushroom Circle.** This fey crossing appears as a circle of mushrooms. The size of the mushrooms and the width of the circle can vary, but activating the fey crossing requires that a particular act be performed inside it or a particular object or creature be present. |
| 6 | **Ruined Tower.** The ruins of an ancient elven tower house a fey crossing. For three nights each year, a ghostly image of the intact tower appears above the ruined foundation, during which time the fey crossing appears as a shimmering doorway that creatures can pass through. |
| 7 | **Stone Bridge.** A Fey creature hides under this ancient stone bridge. In exchange for treasure or some other gift, this Fey can use its innate magic to create a portal atop the bridge that serves as a fey crossing. |
| 8 | **Stone Circle.** This circle of stone megaliths contains a fey crossing that is active during equinoxes and solstices. |
