**Military Force Types**

`dice: [](military-force-types-tce.md#^military-force-types)`

| dice: d6 | Military Organization |
|----------|-----------------------|
| 1 | **Standing Army**. A standing army serves as the highly disciplined and structured guardian of a province or an entire nation. Strict tiers of command ensure coordination between branches of the force. |
| 2 | **Mercenary Company**. Hard-bitten veterans of numerous conflicts, mercenaries serve an employer for coin rather than out of loyalty. |
| 3 | **Expeditionary Force**. This military force is far from home, fighting behind enemy lines or striking into wild, unsettled lands. The force must be fast, self-sufficient, and either diplomatic or decisive to assure their survival. |
| 4 | **Horde**. The horde is almost a force of nature, and what it lacks in discipline it makes up in ferocity. It doesn't have a rigid command structure, instead functioning like a pyramid of smaller armies. Horde commanders owe fealty to stronger leaders above them, all the way up to the warlord. |
| 5 | **Planar Conscripts**. This military force battles for cosmic stakes on far-flung planes of the multiverse or fights against extraplanar invasion on the Material Plane. Warriors include conscripts pressed into service in the Blood War, fodder in the thrall of ruthless yugoloth mercenaries, or members of a glorious celestial host defending against fiendish incursion. |
| 6 | **Sky Warriors**. This military force consists of winged creatures, employs magical flight, or sails airships as a sky navy. Traditional defenses are ineffective against attacks from the air, positioning the sky warriors as a fearsome nation or expensive and coveted mercenaries. |
