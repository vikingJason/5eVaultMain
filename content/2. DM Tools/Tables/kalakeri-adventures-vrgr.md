| dice: d10 | Adventure |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Bandits](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) takes over the village of Neelakurinji, claiming Ramya or Arijani as their leader. In truth they serve neither and are opportunistically robbing those who fear disobeying the factions. An escaped villager entreats the characters for help. |
| 2 | The [stone giant](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/stone-giant.md) guru Jalendu claims to know a path to religious enlightenment. Those who fail to prove their devotion to his teachings turn up [petrified](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified). |
| 3 | The sea boils around an ancient, submerged ruin called the Drowned Altar. With constant upheaval, no one has performed the rites necessary to placate what dwells in the deep. |
| 4 | Dozens of servants were hired to help host a grand gala thrown by Arijani. The event was a success, but none of the servants returned home. Their families entreat the characters to seek answers. |
| 5 | The rare ralvanji spice has miraculous medicinal properties, but by royal edict it is grown only in the gardens of the Cerulean Citadel. Estavan, a mysterious [oni](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/oni.md) merchant, offers to pay good money for the spice and even more for the seeds. |
| 6 | A parent asks the characters to bring their runaway teenager home, not knowing their child joined Ramya's army, died, and returned as a [wight](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/wight.md). |
| 7 | Reeva employs the party to find the forbidden ruins of Bahru, said to lie somewhere in the Ashwagangha Mountains. She believes her ancestors imprisoned a powerful force there, which she hopes to awaken and bend to her service. |
| 8 | The shadows of people in Meenakara are disappearing, and the shadow-bereft soon sicken and die. A local leader claims that the strange plague's cure lies among the hidden isles known as the Ashram of "Niranjan" (detailed in ""Other Domains of Dread"" later in this chapter). |
| 9 | A [commoner](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) begs the characters to prove their sibling's loyalty to Ramya. Time is short, since the sibling was arrested and taken to the Tower of Traitors to face execution. |
| 10 | Ramya desires a consort to cement her rulership and bring stability to the kingdom. A character who is a capable warrior catches her attention. |
