# 20 Things to Say When A PC makes a Perception Check And Finds Nothing
*Source: Raging Swan Press* 

Adventurers are always poking their nose in where it doesn't belong. They seem to incessantly search even the most boring, featureless rooms in search of treasure. Sometimes, they get lucky and find hidden or forgotten loot, but—more often than not—there is simply nothing to find.

Saying, "You find nothing", though, is boring. Use the table below, to inject minor interest into the proceedings (and perhaps to feed your players' paranoia):

**Use the table below, when a PC makes a Perception check and finds nothing.**

| dice: d20 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | You see nothing out of the ordinary, and hear nothing but the laboured breathing of your companions and the creak of their equipment. |
| 2 | A slight breeze plays across your face, but you can't make out where it comes from. |
| 3 | Some of the nearby shadows seem slightly deeper than they should be. |
| 4 | For just a moment, you thought you heard a faint whispered conversation, but it is gone now. |
| 5 | As you search the area, a shiver runs down your spine. Is someone watching you? |
| 6 | You suddenly feel warm, as if you had exerted yourself for sometime. Perhaps it's just the stress of the adventure? |
| 7 | Dust—illuminated by the light—swirls and shimmers in the air creating intricate patterns that form and reform. |
| 8 | A faint odour—perhaps sweat or damp—hangs in the air, but you cannot identify its source. |
| 9 | Your heart pounds loudly in your chest and the roar of blood fills your ears. However, in the area you detect nothing seemingly of interest. |
| 10 | You detect nothing of interest, but something just feels "wrong." Perhaps its paranoia or perhaps its your sixth sense warning of a lurking danger... |
| 11 | You listen intently for the least sound, but suddenly one of your companions coughs loudly and ruins your concentration. |
| 12 | Although you detect no obvious dangers in the immediate area a prickly feeling between your shoulder blades just won't go away... |
| 13 | A sudden breath of wind sighs through the area—it almost sounds like the dungeon itself is breathing... |
| 14 | Marks in the dust are suggestive of something disturbing it, but you don't know what did the disturbing. |
| 15 | Spider webs cluster thickly in one corner. As you watch, the whole mass seems to pulsate and move as if disturbed by air moving through some hidden niche or crack. |
| 16 | As you observe the area, a cold shiver briefly grips your body. As quickly as it comes it goes—what caused it is impossible to say with any certainty. |
| 17 | Sweat drips down your forehead and into your eyes, momentarily blurring your vision. No matter, there is nothing to see here... |
| 18 | Your footsteps echo strangely in this place—as if the area was larger than it first appears. |
| 19 | You don't hear anything out of the ordinary except for a faint sound of ringing in your ears. You wait a few moments, but it doesn't go away. |
| 20 | The area seems safe, but—bizarrely—your nose starts to tingle and you have the overwhelming urge to scratch it. |
