# Item Types

## Artisan's Tools
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 154_

These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. Proficiency with a set of artisan's tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan's tools requires a separate proficiency.

## Bezoar
_Source: Scarlet Citadel, A Dungeon of Secrets p. 199_

### Bezoar

A bezoar is a consumable magic item, similar to a potion, and you must swallow it whole to gain its effects. When you swallow it, you take `1d6 + 1` acid damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an equal amount for the bezoar's duration. The bezoar remains active in your belly for a number of days equal to the damage taken. After that time, you automatically regurgitate the used-up bezoar, for which you take another `1d6 + 1` acid damage, but your hit point maximum returns to normal. A used-up bezoar has no power and soon crumbles away.

A bezoar can be removed prior to its full duration with a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check but still deals the secondary damage as you regurgitate it. A partially used bezoar recharges itself after being out of a body for 24 hours. Swallowing it again after that allows a new roll for duration. You can only have one bezoar active at a time, and while one is active, you do not gain any benefit from other consumable magic items, such as potions. While uncomfortable, this doesn't impact your ability to eat and drink though.

Owlbears are not picky eaters and wind up devouring all sorts of nastiness: carrion, furry creatures, fey river stones, feathery things, nut shells, fish bones, and shadow-fused bone. As such, any bezoar has a 50% chance of being cursed. You can't remove a cursed bezoar before its full duration (when you will regurgitate it as normal) unless you are first targeted by a [remove curse](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse.md) spell. However, if the bezoar is not removed before your next short or long rest after the spell's casting, the curse returns. The curse ends automatically once the bezoar is regurgitated.

## Clockwork Creation
_Source: Tome of Heroes p. 201_

Only the greatest tinkerers and clockwork priests can build gearforged bodies and coax fading souls into gearforged soul gems, but gearforged aren't the only clockwork creations. Many clockwork crafters build devices and automatons suited to more mundane tasks. Each clockwork creation comes with a control rod branded with the creator's maker's mark and bound to that specific creation. Though the original control rods were actual rods, the control rod for a clockwork creation can be any metal object. Many control rods exist in the shape of amulets, weapons, bracelets, other jewelry, or even in the metal symbols on shields. The creature holding or carrying the control rod can command the clockwork creation as if it was the original creator, but the control rod must be within 100 feet of the clockwork creation for the holder to command the creation.

Some clockwork creations come with certain modifications already installed. See the Clockwork Modifications section later in this chapter for details on these modifications

Consult with your GM before choosing clockwork creations for your character. Clockwork creations might not exist at all, or might be more or less scarce (and, therefore, more or less expensive) in the campaign world.

## Clockwork Modification
_Source: Tome of Heroes p. 203_

Many clockwork crafters make a living off of modifying clockwork creations rather than creating them. Each of the following modifications takes `3d6` days to complete, and the clockwork creation must remain with the clockwork crafter for the duration. Some modifications can't be applied to a creation if another, conflicting modification has already been applied to a creation.

Unless specified otherwise, a clockwork creation can't have the same modification more than once. This also applies to clockwork creations that come with modifications already built into them. For example, the clockwork gardener has the Hidden Compartment modification, which means it can't have that modification again and it can't have the Chemical Reservoir modification.

## Gaming Set
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 154_

If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.

Proficiency with a gaming set applies to one type of game, such as Three-Dragon Ante or games of chance that use dice.

### Components

A gaming set has all the pieces needed to play a specific game or type of game, such as a complete deck of cards or a board and tokens.

### History

Your mastery of a game includes knowledge of its history, as well as of important events it was connected to or prominent historical figures involved with it.

### Insight

Playing games with someone is a good way to gain understanding of their personality, granting you a better ability to discern their lies from their truths and read their mood.

### Sleight of Hand

Sleight of Hand is a useful skill for cheating at a game, as it allows you to swap pieces, palm cards, or alter a die roll. Alternatively, engrossing a target in a game by manipulating the components with dexterous movements is a great distraction for a pickpocketing attempt.

## Instrument
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 154_

If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.

Proficiency with a musical instrument indicates you are familiar with the techniques used to play it. You also have knowledge of some songs commonly performed with that instrument.

### History

Your expertise aids you in recalling lore related to your instrument.

### Performance

Your ability to put on a good show is improved when you incorporate an instrument into your act.

### Compose a Tune

As part of a long rest, you can compose a new tune and lyrics for your instrument. You might use this ability to impress a noble or spread scandalous rumors with a catchy tune.

## Magic Plant
_Source: Tome of Heroes p. 263_

Magic plants are rare, exceptional specimens that stand out among more common varietals and have a few notable qualities. Magic plants can grow nearly anywhere, though each type of plant has an affinity for certain locations. Unless carefully tended, magic plants expire swiftly when outside their preferred growing environments. A magic plant that is harvested or separated from its soil by someone without the [Hedgecraft](2-Mechanics/CLI/feats/hedgecraft-toh.md) feat has a 10 percent chance of wasting away after 24 hours. Otherwise, a fresh cutting of a magic plant remains usable and magical for up to 10 days.

To find and identify a wild magic plant, a character must make an Intelligence ([Investigation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check in a magic plant's preferred growing environment (see each magic plant's entry for details on these environments). To harvest a wild magic plant, a character must make an Intelligence ([Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. The DC is the same for both checks and can be found on the Magic Plant Rarity table. If the harvesting skill check is a failure, the magic plant is destroyed unless the harvesting character has the [Hedgecraft](2-Mechanics/CLI/feats/hedgecraft-toh.md) feat. Due to their transient nature, there are no magic plants of common rarity.

If a magic plant was cultivated in a garden and the garden is maintained, a character doesn't need to make either of these checks to find or harvest cuttings from the plants. However, other factors, such as angry gardeners or the garden belonging to a noble personage, might deter the character from harvesting magic plants from gardens.

A ceremonial wort with a level in parenthesis indicates that wort can be used only by a character of that level or higher. A cultivated wort with a level in parenthesis indicates that wort can be activated only when cultivated by a gardener of that level or higher. If an existing and maintained garden of the plant is tended for at least one workweek by a gardener of the appropriate level with the Hedgecraft feat, the plant's cultivated wort then becomes active.

A minor wort always requires 1 dried or fresh cutting of a magic plant. Ceremony worts require fresh cuttings and each entry notes how many cuttings are required to perform these worts.

## Range
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 146_

A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

## Ritual Book
_Source: Traders And Merchants p. 20_

Characters that are able to transcribe spells into a tome for ritual casting can copy spells out of the spell scrolls and ritual books. [Wizard](2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/wizard.md) characters may also copy into their spellbook non-ritual spells of a level that they can cast from spell scrolls. Regardless, copying a spell from a spell scroll requires a check detailed in the spell scroll's rules section, while copying a ritual spell from either source still requires an expenditure of time and wealth detailed in features that grant ritual casting, and copying a spell into a spellbook erases it from a ritual book or spell scroll.

## Seed
_Source: Traders And Merchants p. 8_

### Seeds

Found in various shapes and sizes, these seeds require fertile land to grow, and your DM is the ultimate source on whether or not a plot of land can sustain plant life. Crop and flower seeds require 100 consecutive days of maintenance to mature fully, while trees require 1,800 days to begin producing seeds and fruit. A handful of crop or flower seeds can fill four 5-foot by 5-foot squares with their associated plant. The space a tree takes up varies greatly, depending on the type of tree and its age.

## Special Material
_Source: Tome of Heroes p. 194_

Though leather and iron are the most common materials for creating armor and weapons, artisans in fantasy worlds can have access to a wide variety of crafting materials. Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to weapons made from other materials. Likewise, some materials are more resilient, lighter, or can enhance the wielder's abilities, making them moreideal than traditional weapons in specific situations.

Consult with your GM before choosing armor or weapons made of special materials, as they might not exist or might be more or less scarce (and therefore more or less expensive) in the campaign world.

## Trade Good
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 146_

Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources (such as a mine or a forest).

Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered companies are granted rights to conduct trade along certain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods or services that they control, and determine who may or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency.

## Vehicle (Air)
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 119_

### Crew

A ship needs a crew of skilled hirelings to function. As per the Player's Handbook, one skilled hireling costs at least 2 gp per day. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of vessel.

You can track the loyalty of individual crew members or the crew as a whole using the optional loyalty rules in chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If at least half the crew becomes disloyal during a voyage, the crew turns hostile and stages a mutiny. If the ship is berthed, disloyal crew members leave the ship and never return.

### Passengers

This indicates the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate.

Accommodations consist of shared hammocks in tight quarters. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers.

A passenger is usually expected to pay 5 sp per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 gp per day.

### Cargo

The maximum tonnage the ship can carry.

### Damage Threshold

If a ship has a Damage Threshold, it has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the ship's hit points.

### Ship Repair

Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor.

## War Animal
_Source: Tome of Heroes p. 204_

A beast trained for combat, such as a [warhorse](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/warhorse.md) or [pit terrier](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/pit-terrier-toh.md), doesn't get spooked or flee when it is in an area of conflict. The beast knows which humanoids are friendly to it and which ones aren't, even in a pitched battle.

Unless specified otherwise in its entry, a combat-trained beast will take commands from its designated humanoids. One such humanoid can use an action to command the beast to [Attack](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Attack), [Dash](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage), [Dodge](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dodge), [Help](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Help), [Hide](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Hide), or [Use an Object](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Use%20an%20Object) by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check. On a failure, the beast defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. The [Use an Object](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Use%20an%20Object) command can be used to deliver an object to another humanoid or to fetch an object from a willing creature or an object that isn't being worn or carried. While a combat-trained beast is being used as a mount in mounted combat, it follows the rules for a controlled mount instead.

A combat-trained beast can be trained to obey up to four humanoids. Each humanoid must spend one week training with the beast before it learns to obey that humanoid. If the beast is trained to obey a new humanoid when it already obeys four, it no longer obeys the humanoid whose most recent command to it was issued the longest amount of time ago and obeys the new humanoid instead. At the GM's discretion, a beast with a particularly strong bond with one or more humanoids might not forget those humanoids. In such cases, training the beast to obey a new humanoid when it already obeys four fails.

### Installation

Some items must be **installed** in your stronghold in order to function. Such items cease to function if taken from the stronghold in which they were installed, and must be reinstalled to regain their power, though their powers may still work on *you* if you leave.
