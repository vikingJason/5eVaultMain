<br>

## General Rules
### Magical Items
Magical items are rare and expensive. Most known magical items belong to rich or powerful families and are treated as heirlooms. While potions of various kinds may be available, magic items will rarely be found in shops anywhere except major metropolitan areas, and even then they are a rare sight.

### Weapons
Weapons grant additional abilites if you are proficient with said weapon. Refer to provided document “Beyond Damage Dice”

### Helping
Players can only use the help action for performing a skill check if they are proficient in that skill and give a reasonable explanation of how they are helping. DM has discretion if helping with a skill check is possible.

### Exhausted [CONDITION]
While you are subjected to the Exhausted Condition (known in older books as Exhaustion), you experience the following effects: 
- **Levels of Exhaustion.** This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds 10.
- **d20 Rolls Affected.** When you make a d20 Test, you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.
- **Spell Save DCs Affected.** Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.
- **Ending the Condition.** Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. When your exhaustion level reaches 0, you are no longer Exhausted.

### Expertise Dice
Some class features or abilities grant you an expertise die for an attack roll or saving throw, or in a specific skill or tool proficiency. When you make a d20 roll with which you have gained an expertise die, roll 1d4 and add the number rolled to the result of your check.

You can never roll more than one expertise die on the same roll. If another class feature or situation grants an expertise die that applies to the same roll, you don’t gain another die; instead, the size of the expertise die increases for that check, from 1d4 to 1d6, or 1d6 to 1d8. If you have a 1d8 expertise die on a check, further expertise dice have no effect.

If you have advantage or disadvantage at the same time as an expertise die, only the d20 is rolled twice, not the expertise die.

While advantage is most commonly used to represent circumstantial factors affecting a situation, expertise dice represents the particular training a character takes into the adventure.

## Combat Rules
### Flanking
When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.
**A creature who is currently Flanked can not provide a Flanking Advantage.**

### Critical Hit 
When you score a Critical Hit on an Attack Roll (weapon or spell attack), the damage will be determined by applying the full die value for the attack and adding the value of what is rolled.
e.g. a Critical Hit with a Battle Axe (1d8) = 8 + (1d8) +damage modifier

If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the Paladin’s Divine Smite feature, this rule applies to those damage dice as well.
e.g. a Critical Hit with a Battle Axe (1d8) + Divine Smite (2d8) = 8 + (1d8) + damage modifier + 16 + (2d8)

### Critical Fails  
A critical fail on a:
* **melee attack roll,** the target creature will be able to use its reaction to make an Attack of Opportunity
* **spell attack roll,** the magic surges back at the caster forcing them to make a saving throw using their spellcasting ability (DC equal to 10 + spell level). On a fail, they take 1d6 Force Damage and are stunned until the start of their next turn.
* **ranged attack roll,** the weapon breaks/jams, the creature must take an action to repair instantly or a Bonus Action and roll a DC 12 DEX (Weapon Proficiency/Woodworkers Tools) check to repair before the weapon can be used again.

### Cinematic Advantage.
A swashbuckling rogue swinging from a chandelier to get behind her foe, a raging barbarian diving through a wall to lay waste to the villain on the other side. Player characters can attempt to gain a circumstantial bonus on their next attack roll by creating awesome cinematic moments.

Players describe to the DM how they want to gain advantage. The DM calls for a skill check and sets a DC and a consequence for failure (typically making the roll with disadvantage, but could also involve falling prone, or even more severe consequences for failing by 5 or more) and informs the player of both the DC and the consequences.

The player can then makes the skill check and gains advantage on their next attack on a success, or suffers the consequence on a failed attempt.

### Massive Damage   
When you take damage from any source that deals more than half of your current HP, you must make a Constitution Saving throw (DC is 10 or half the damage taken - whichever is higher) or roll on the system shock table

| dice: d10 | Effect                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1         | The creature drops to 0 hit points.                                                                                       |
| 2-3       | The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable.                                                                         |
| 4-5       | The creature is [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn.              |
| 6-7       | The creature can't take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10      | The creature can't take reactions until the end of its next turn.                                                         |

### Potions
A character can consume a healing potion by using an action or bonus action.
* **Action:** You will benefit from the full effect of the potion, e.g. Potion of Healing (2d4+2) = 10hp 
* **Bonus Action:** You will roll the attributed dice to determine the effect of the potion, e.g. Potion of Healing (2d4+2) = (3 + 1) + 2 = 6hp
* A character can administer the potion to another creature as an action, causing that creature to heal the max amount.

### Downed and Up
If a creature is reduced to zero hit points and becomes unconscious, you gain one level of Exhaustion that comes into effect immediately when you are stabilized.

### Death Saving Throws
To add suspense to combat, the DM will make all Death Saving rolls behind the DM screen for ALL characters, including NPCs and Player Characters.
 
### Initiating Sudden Combat
Sometimes all participants are aware of each other at the beginning of an encounter, but one side takes an action or launches an attack while others' guards are down. In this case, no one is surprised, but the DM may allow the instigating creature or party to roll initiative with advantage.

### Overexherting yourself
When times are tough, you may opt to overexert yourselves to complete a physical act or one that requires a force of will, including (but not limited to)
* Make an additional attack
* Doubling a damage roll
* Running that little bit further/faster
* Re-Roll to maintain a Concentration Spell

After the action is complete the the player receives 1 level of Exhaustion. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) per long rest

### Additional Action Options
This section provides new action options for combat as per DMG: pg 271
#### Climb onto a Bigger Creature
If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength ([[Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check contested by the target's Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ([[Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

#### Disarm
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength ([[Athletics]]) check or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

#### Mark
This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.

When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the [[incapacitated]] condition or the [[shocking grasp]] spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.

#### Overrun
When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength ([[Athletics]]) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

#### Shove Aside
With this option, a creature uses the special [[shove]] attack from the "Player's Handbook" to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength ([[Athletics]]) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.

#### Tumble
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

#### Attacking From Above
If you are at least 5 feet above your target and you aren’t grappled or restrained, you gain an expertise die on melee attack rolls made against it.

#### Back-To-Back
When you are within 5 feet of an ally, you can use a bonus action to stand back-to-back. While back-to-back with an ally, it is harder to be caught off guard, and you cannot be flanked.

#### Press the Attack
Before you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to designate one creature within your reach that isn’t currently the target of a Press the Attack action. Until the start of your next turn, your melee attacks against that creature gain an expertise die, and all attacks against you are made with advantage. You can’t gain expertise dice in this way on attacks made with disadvantage. When you Press the Attack, your target can use its reaction to Fall Back.

#### Fall Back 
Whenever a creature takes the Press the Attack bonus action against you, you can use your reaction to yield ground. You move backwards 5 feet, and your attacker does not gain an expertise die against you from using Press the Attack. As part of its action, your attacker can move 5 feet towards you. Neither you nor the attacker provoke opportunity attacks from this movement. A creature using the Rage class feature can’t choose to Fall Back.

#### Dragging An Ally
While adjacent to a willing ally, you can use your reaction to grab them by the hand and pull them along with your movement even if they've already expended all of theirs. While doing so, every foot of movement costs you an additional 2 feet of movement, and the ally cannot use their reaction. This movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal.

### Pulling From Below

If you are at least 5 feet below your target, your target is your size or smaller, and you aren't [[grappled]] or [[restrained]], you gain an expertise die on [[Strength]] checks and saving throws made against it.

## Healing
#### Healer's Kit
**5 gp, 3 lbs.** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

With Healer's Kit you can use the First Aid, Long Rest Care and Resuscitate actions.

#### Herbalist's Kit
**5 gp, 3 lbs.** This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. The kit has 10 uses. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to identify and apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and any potion of healing.

With Herbalist's Kit you can use Treat Poison and Treat Disease actions, as well as the Long Rest Care.

You can refill one use of the Herbalist Kit with a Wisdom (Nature) check gathering herbs from their environment, with the DC value dependent on their availability.

#### Surgeon's Kit
**100 gp, 10 lbs. Heavy (2 Bulk)** This kit contains scalpels, scissors and saws, grasping forceps, and vials of alcohol. You must be proficient in Medicine to use Surgeon's Kit. This kit lets you use the First Aid action and benefit from advantage to the Wisdom (Medicine) check. Also, you can attempt the Perform Surgery actions.

A Surgeons Kit can be reused when all uses are spent, and can be refilled with 10 uses for 40 gold.

### Healing Actions
##### First Aid
By spending a use of Healer's or Surgeon's Kit, you attempt to tend to an injured person until full medical treatment or rest is possible, the creature gains 1d4 hit points.  
Once you attempt a First Aid on a creature, you cannot attempt again until the creature completes a long rest.

##### Short Rest Care
By spending one use of Healer's or Herbalist's Kit, you can ease the suffering of one injured creature during its long rest. While spending Hit Dice to recover hit points during the short rest, the creature can choose one of the dice and change it to the maximum value of the die. Also, the creature benefits from an advantage to its next Constitution saving throw made during the long rest.

##### Resuscitate
By spending a use of Healer's Kit, you attempt to stabilize and return creature to life despite clinical death. A dead creature can still be returned to life within number of combat rounds equal to 1 + the number of successful death saves it scored before dying. Attempt a Wisdom (Medicine) check against DC 30 - 5 for each successful death save the creature had before dying.

If you succeed, the creature can immediately repeat one of its death saves with advantage. If it succeeds on it, it can repeat another death save with advantage. It can continue to do this until it scores one failure. Upon scoring one failure, it dies and can not be Resuscitated again. A creature may not be Resuscitated more than once until it finishes a long rest.

##### Treat Poison
By spending a use of Herbalist's Kit, you provide immediate assistance against the effect of poison. The creature gains resistance to the next damage it receives from the poison and can immediately repeat the saving throw against the effect of poison. You can also spend another use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against the Poison's DC. If you succeed, the creature gains advantage to its saving throw. You cannot Treat Poison again until the creature completes a long rest.

##### Treat Disease
By spending a use of Herbalist's Kit, you provide relief from a disease and prevent is further spreading. The creature can immediately repeat the saving throw against the effect of disease. You can also spend another use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against the Disease's DC. If you succeed, the creature gains advantage to its saving throw. In addition, any check against contracting the disease from the sick creature is made with advantage. You cannot Treat Disease again until the creature completes a long rest.

## Resting and Recovery
### Breather
Taking a breather is a short period of rest, at least 5 minutes long, after a strenuous activity. During that time you may rest, slake your thirst and hunger, or check on a single wound and bandage it.

During a breather, you may spend one Hit Die for healing or removing a Wound. If a Hit Die is spent to heal, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total.

### Short Rest
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which you do nothing more strenuous than light activity like eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

You can spend Hit Dice at the end of a short rest for recovery. For each Hit Die spent in this way, you roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain hit points equal to the total. If you have exactly 1 level of Exhaustion, you can remove that level.

You can't benefit from more than two short rest in a 24-hour period, and you must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

### Long Rest
A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity - at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity - you must begin the rest again to gain any benefit.

At the end of a long rest, you regain all hit points spell slots. You regain up to half of your total number of Hit Dice.

During a long rest, you must consume at least 2 pints of water and 1 ration. If you consume at least one sustenance, food or water, you do not gain any exhaustion. If you consume both food and water, you remove one level of exhaustion. 

If you sleep in Medium or Heavy Armor other than Hide, you are roughing it, you regain half the usual number of Hit Dice, and you are prevented from reducing your Exhaustion during the rest.

You can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period *, and you must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits*.

### Eating and Drinking
You must consume at least 1 rations and 4 pints of water (a waterskin) per day. If you do not consume water, you gain 1 level of Exhaustion. If you cannot consume food, you cannot recover Exhaustion during this day.

<br>

## Magic
### Spell Slots
When a creature has no remaining Spell Slots, the creature can cast a spell but will take levels of exhaustion equal to the level of the spell cast.

### Spell Scrolls
A character can attempt to use a spell scroll to cast a spell that is not on their class spell list or to cast the spell at a higher level, up to a level that meets what the character can normally cast, by making an Intelligence (Arcana) Check against a DC of 10 + the level at which they cast the spell. On a failure, the creature rolls on the Scroll Mishap table.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | A surge of magical energy deals the caster **1d6** force damage per level of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2   | The spell affects the caster or an ally (determined randomly) instead of the intended target, or it affects a random target nearby if the caster was the intended target.                                                                                                                              |
| 3   | The spell affects a random location within the spell's range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4   | The spell's effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a fireball might produce an area of harmless cold.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5   | The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect related to the spell. Such effects last only as long as the original spell's duration, or **1d10** minutes for spells that take effect instantaneously. For example, a fireball might cause smoke to billow from the caster's ears for **1d10** minutes. |
| 6   | The spell activates after **1d12** hours. If the caster was the intended target, the spell takes effect normally. If the caster was not the intended target, the spell goes off in the general direction of the intended target, up to the spell's maximum range, if the target has moved away.        |

### Spell Casting
If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you can’t cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action

### Wild Magic Surge
Once per turn, you must roll a d20 immediately after you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. The DC starts at 1 and increases +1 for each subsequent success and resets back to 1 on a failure.

On a failed check, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

### Counterspell a Counterspell
A creature that casts Counterspell as a Reaction to another creature casting Counterspell causes a Wild Magic surge and must roll Wild Magic Surge check.

## Hunger Rules
### Appetite
Your **appetite** represents how much food you need to eat to satisfy your hunger in a single sitting, and it's determined by your muscularity, mass, size, and environment.

**Appetite** = your Strength score + your Constitution score

The Appetite Modifiers table shows the circumstances that affect your appetite. If one of the factors applies to you, your appetite is updated accordingly.

##### Appetite Modifiers
| Factor                                                | Appetite Multiplier      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Size: small                                           | ½                        |
| Size: medium                                          | 1                        |
| Size: large                                           | 4                        |
| Weather: extreme cold                                 | 2                        |
| Condition: poisoned, or afflicted with a disease | -1                       |
| Condition: exhaustion                                 | 1.1 per exhaustion level |

A negative appetite is impossible to fill regardless of its magnitude, thus you cannot eat to address your hunger until your appetite is back to normal.

If several factors apply, they multiply together. A young red dragon in extreme cold, for example, has an appetite of 352.

### Hunger Condition
**Hunger** is a special condition that indicates how starved a creature is. Every creature has some level of hunger, and it fluctuates naturally over time. The Hunger Effects table shows the levels of this condition and their effects.

##### Hunger Effects
| Level        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Hunger Progression
At the start of each mealtime, your hunger increases by one. 

### Meals
There are three mealtimes in a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Snacks between meals count toward the next meal. Each time you eat, roll the food's **diet dice**, which represent the degree that food can satiate hunger.

Nutritious, hearty dishes use small dice. Fatty, fast-cooking dishes loaded with salt use large dice. The amount of dice inreases with the quantity of the food. Food too small to affect your hunger (e.g., a single grape), has no diet dice.

The Sample Menu table shows example dishes grouped in meals and their diet dice. These meals are calibrated for a human commoner and must be adjusted for other creatures.

##### Sample Menu

| Heroes' Feast | strawberries in chocolate sauce (1d4) <br>moist coffee crumble cake (1d4) <br>cream cheese lemon bars (1d4) <br>large banana split (1d4) <br>other magically nutritious dishes (4d4) |
By the end of the mealtime, roll the **diet dice** and find which range the total of the roll fits from the Diet Dice Result table. Apply the effect corresponding to that result. If you did _not_ eat, your diet dice total is 0.

##### Diet Dice Result
| Range                                                     | Effect on Hunger Level |

| At least half but less than the quarters of your appetite | +0                     |
| At least three quarters but not equal to your appetite    | -1                     |
| At least equal but not three halves your appetite         | -2 (max: bursting)     |
| At least three-halves but less than twice your appetite   | -3 (max: bursting)     |

## Drinking
### Intoxication Threshold
You have an intoxication threshold that is equal to your 1 + your Constitution modifier (Minimum of 1). Once a player reaches this threshold they are granted "Liquid Courage".

Drinks have 6 levels of strength; the number at the end of the description indicates it's exhaustion save increase:

| Range                                                     | Description | Intoication per Drink |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
|Diluted (Str 1) | The drink is watered down; every 5 drinks adds a level of intoxication. These drinks typically cost 1 to 5 cp. | **0.2** |
|Weak  (Str 2)| Every 2 weak beverages adds a level of intoxication. These drinks typically costs 5 to 10 cp. | **0.5** |
| Moderate (Str 3) | A moderate beverage adds a level of intoxication. These drinks typically cost 1 to 5 sp. | **1** |
| Strong (Str 4) | A strong beverage adds 2 levels of intoxication. These drinks typically cost 5 sp to 1 gp. | **2** |
| Very strong (Str 5) | A very strong beverage adds 3 levels of intoxication. These drinks typically cost 1 to 10 gp. | **3** |
| Dangerously strong (Str 6) | A dangerously strong beverage adds 5-levels of intoxication. These drinks range wildly in prices depending on where they are purchased from, but are always at least 10 gp. | **5** |
| Blackout | Once reaching their intoxication threshold, any drink after causes the creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, becoming blackout drunk and rolling on the Blackout table on a failed save. |  |

### Liquid Courage
Liquid courage grants you the following effects for 1d4 hours

| Effect                                                     | Description |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 | 5 temporary hit points |
| 2 | Advantage on Charisma skill checks. |
| 3 | Advantage on saving throws made against fear. |
| 4 | Advantage on Charisma ability checks. |

as well as:

- Disadvantage on Wisdom and Dexterity saving throws.
- Disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom skill checks.

### Blackout Table
Roll 1d10 to determine the outcome once a Blackout occurs:

| Range                                                     | Description |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1-3 | You fall unconscious taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage and remain unconscious for 1d8 hours |
| 4-5 | You pick a fight with a nearby patron, use an action to make an unarmed strike, all Extra Attacks as well; if the patron is intoxicated at all, roll a D20 to determine how they react - on an Odd, the patron responds in a hostile manner, on an Even, the patron laughs it off as a joke |
| 6-7 | You gain 1 level of exhaustion, you pick a fight with a random party member, using an action to make an unarmed strike, all Extra Attacks as well. |
| 8 | You gain 1 level of exhaustion, you are overtaken by generosity in your inebriated state and you give away 10d12x2 gold, or as much as you own compared to the roll |
| 9 | You gain 1 level of exhaustion, you spend 10d12 gold on drinks for all around you; you owe the amount rolled to the barkeep even if you do not have enough to cover the bill |
| 10 | You gain 1 level of exhaustion and take another drink forcing you to roll on the Blackout table again |
 
### After the Threshold
Furthermore, you must make a Constitution saving throw save after each drink consumed past their threshold. The DC is equal 8 + the strength of the drink + your level of intoxication. If you fail, you gain one level of exhaustion. If you fail the save by 5 or more, you take a second level of exhaustion.

### Detoxing and Hangovers
- Your levels of intoxication are decreased by 2 at the end of a short rest and reset at the end of a long rest. If you have at least 1 level of exhaustion gained from intoxication and no levels of intoxication, you have a hangover.
- While you’re hungover, you are vulnerable to thunder damage and have disadvantage on saving throws against being blinded. You lose 4 levels of intoxication from a use of lesser restoration.
- You lose your hangover at the end of a long rest or from a use of greater restoration (must be used after exhaustion is cured).

## Weapons, Shields and Armor
### Weapon Properties

All weapons may deal the same basic types of damage, but they also have special properties that make each unique. You can only benefit from properties marked with † if you are proficient with the weapon.

**Breaker.** This weapon deals double damage to unattended objects, such as doors and walls. If this property only applies to a specific type of material, such as wood, it is stated in parenthesis after this property.   

**Compounding.** You use only your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Defensive.** This weapon is designed to be used with a shield of the stated degree or lighter (light, medium, or heavy). When you make an attack with this weapon and are using a shield designed for it, you can use a bonus action to either make an attack with your shield or increase your Armor Class by 1 until the start of your next turn.

**Dual-Wielding**. This weapon is designed to be wielded in concert with another weapon. When wielding another weapon in your main hand that does not have the heavy property, you can use your bonus action to make an attack with this weapon (see Two-Weapon Fighting). 

**Finesse.** You may choose to use your Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

**Hand-Mounted.** This weapon is affixed to your hand. You can do simple activities such as climbing a ladder while wielding this weapon, and you have advantage made to resist being disarmed. You cannot use a hand that is wielding a hand-mounted weapon to do complex tasks like picking a pocket, using thieves’ tools to bypass a lock, or casting spells with seen components.

**Heavy.** This weapon is too large for Small creatures to use effectively. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. 

**Loading.** This weapon must be loaded before it can be used. You may only make one attack with a loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. 

**Mounted.** This weapon deals the damage listed in parenthesis when you are wielding it while mounted.

**Parrying.** When you are wielding this weapon and you are not using a shield, once before your next turn you can gain an expertise die to your AC against a single melee attack made against you by a creature you can see. You cannot use this property while [[incapacitated]], [[paralyzed]], [[restrained]], or [[stunned]].

**Parrying Immunity.** Attacks with this weapon ignore the parrying property and Armor Class bonuses from shields.

**Range.** This weapon fires ammunition. The range lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range.

**Reach.** This weapon can be used to make attacks against targets within 10 feet. If a weapon has a longer reach, it is stated in parentheses after this property.

**Simple.** This weapon can be used with very little skill or training, and all creatures gain proficiency with it.

**Thrown.** This weapon can be thrown as a ranged weapon attack. The thrown property lists two numbers after it, both measured in feet—the first is the weapon’s normal thrown range, and the second is the weapon’s maximum range. You have disadvantage on attack rolls made beyond the weapon’s normal range, and you cannot make attacks against targets beyond the weapon’s maximum range. Additionally, when using this weapon to make a ranged weapon attack, you may choose to use your Strength modifier or Dexterity modifier for its attack and damage roll.

**Trip.** When used with a combat manoeuvre that trips a creature or the Knockdown attack, this weapon add +1 to your roll. If the target is mounted, it adds +2.

**Two-Handed.** You must use two hands to wield this weapon.

**Versatile.** This weapon may be wielded with one or both hands. If wielded with both hands, it deals the damage listed in parentheses.

**Vicious.** A vicious weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you already have a feature that increases the range of your critical hits, your critical hit range increases by 1 (maximum 17–20).


### Shields

**Light.** Light shields increase your Armor Class by 1. You may throw this shield, treating it as an improvised weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Medium.** Medium shields increase your Armor Class by 2.

**Heavy.** Heavy shields increase your Armor Class by 2 and you gain an expertise die on [[Dexterity]] saving throws. When you take the Dodge action while wielding a heavy shield, you may instead take cover behind your shield, gaining an expertise die to your Armor Class until the start of your turn. You have disadvantage on [[Dexterity]] ([[Acrobatics]]) and [[Dexterity]] ([[Stealth]]) checks while wielding a heavy shield, and you cannot squeeze through spaces smaller than your size category.

**Tower.** Tower shields share the properties of a heavy shield. These shields cover the entire body and reduce your Speed by 10 feet. On your turn, you may use an object interaction to plant it in the ground, gaining half cover (+2 bonus to AC, [[Dexterity]] saving throws, and ability checks made to hide) and advantage on saving throws made to resist being shoved or knocked [[prone]] and while you remain behind it. Unplanting a tower shield requires a bonus action.

Tower shields are bulky items, and count as such even when donned.

#### Improvised Shields

If you are proficient with shields, you can use an action to pick up a nearby object of your size category or larger to use as a shield. The size of the object determines the degree of shield it becomes: an object your size can be used as a light shield, or an object of one size category larger can be used as a medium shield.

An improvised shield is destroyed when you take a critical hit (it cannot be sacrificed), it cannot be repaired or customized, and it becomes useless after 10 rounds of combat.

#### Sacrifice Shield

When you take a critical hit, you can use your reaction to block it and sacrifice your shield, turning the critical hit into a regular hit. Afterwards your shield is broken, or if your shield is magical it instead becomes mundane for 1 hour.

### Armor
#### Helms

Helms fit over your head to protect your skull, though in exchange they limit your vision and hearing. No proficiency is required to wear a helm.

**Helm (12g, 4lbs).** This hard leather or metal covering protects the head but not the face, with the exception of a strip over the nose. While wearing this helm you gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being [[stunned]], and your passive Perception score is reduced by 2.

**Visored Helm (25gp, 8 lbs).** This helm covers the entirety of the head, including the face; the visor may be moved out of the way of the face as an object interaction, in which case the visored helm functions as a standard helm. While wearing a visored helm you gain an expertise die on saving throws made to resist being [[charmed]] or [[stunned]], and your passive Perception score is reduced by 5. Additionally, whenever you take damage from falling, you reduce that damage by 5.



<br>

## Called Shots 
When a character makes an weapon attack, it can choose to make the attack a Called Shot, before it rolls the die. If it does, it must choose where on the body of its enemy it is attacking. Oozes, Constructs, Undead, Plants, and Elementals are immune to the effects of called shots. As well, some characters will not have the pieces of anatomy required for the Called Shot to take full effect. The permanent effects of Called Shots can be removed via [[Greater Restoration]].

These rules are designed to make higher level combat less of a slog and to make Martial Characters more deadly. As the DM, you can adjust penalties and affects to fit your playstyle and world.

### Types of Called Shots

|Body Part|Penalty|Effect|Critical Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|Arm|Disadvantage & -4|Target has disadvantage on their next melee attack.|Target has disadvantage on melee attacks until they take a short rest.|
