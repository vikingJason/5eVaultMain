## Rules: Homebrew/Clarification 
### Counterspell a Counterspell

If a creature casts Counterspell as a Reaction to another creature casting Counterspell it causes a Wild Magic surge at the midpoint between the two casters.


### Critical Hit 
When you score a Critical Hit on an Attack Roll (weapon or spell attack), the damage will be determined by applying the full die value for the attack and adding the value of what is rolled.
e.g. a Critical Hit with a Battle Axe (1d8) = 8 + (1d8) +damage modifier

If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the Paladin’s Divine Smite feature, this rule applies to those damage dice as well.
e.g. a Critical Hit with a Battle Axe (1d8) + Divine Smite (2d8) = 8 + (1d8) + damage modifier + 16 + (2d8)


### Critical Fails  
A critical fail on a:
* **melee attack roll,** the target creature will be able to use its reaction to make an Attack of Opportunity
* **spell attack roll,** the magic surges back at the caster forcing them to make a saving throw using their spellcasting ability (DC equal to 10 + spell level). On a fail, they take 1d6 Force Damage and are stunned until the start of their next turn.
* **ranged attack roll,** the weapon breaks/jams, the creature must take an action to repair instantly or a Bonus Action and roll a DC 12 DEX (Weapon Proficiency/Woodworkers Tools) check to repair before the weapon can be used again.

  
### Massive Damage   
When you take damage from any source that deals more than half of your current HP, you must make a Constitution Saving throw (DC is 10 or half the damage taken - whichever is higher) or roll on the system shock table

| dice: d10 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The creature drops to 0 hit points. |
| 2-3 | The creature drops to 0 hit points but is stable. |
| 4-5 | The creature is [stunned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn. |
| 6-7 | The creature can't take reactions and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. |
| 8-10 | The creature can't take reactions until the end of its next turn. |


### Exhausted [CONDITION]
While you are subjected to the Exhausted Condition (known in older books as Exhaustion), you experience the following effects: 
- **Levels of Exhaustion.** This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of exhaustion. You die if your exhaustion level exceeds 10.
- **d20 Rolls Affected.** When you make a d20 Test, you subtract your exhaustion level from the d20 roll.
- **Spell Save DCs Affected.** Subtract your exhaustion level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.
- **Ending the Condition.** Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your levels of exhaustion. When your exhaustion level reaches 0, you are no longer Exhausted.		


### Spell Slots
When a creature has no remaining Spell Slots, the creature can cast a spell but will take levels of exhaustion equal to the level of the spell cast.

### Spell Scrolls
A character can attempt to use a spell scroll to cast a spell that is not on their class spell list or to cast the spell at a higher level, up to a level that meets what the character can normally cast, by making an Intelligence (Arcana) Check against a DC of 10 + the level at which they cast the spell. On a failure, the creature rolls on the Scroll Mishap table.

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | A surge of magical energy deals the caster **1d6** force damage per level of the spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2   | The spell affects the caster or an ally (determined randomly) instead of the intended target, or it affects a random target nearby if the caster was the intended target.                                                                                                                              |
| 3   | The spell affects a random location within the spell's range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 4   | The spell's effect is contrary to its normal one, but neither harmful nor beneficial. For instance, a fireball might produce an area of harmless cold.                                                                                                                                                 |
| 5   | The caster suffers a minor but bizarre effect related to the spell. Such effects last only as long as the original spell's duration, or **1d10** minutes for spells that take effect instantaneously. For example, a fireball might cause smoke to billow from the caster's ears for **1d10** minutes. |
| 6   | The spell activates after **1d12** hours. If the caster was the intended target, the spell takes effect normally. If the caster was not the intended target, the spell goes off in the general direction of the intended target, up to the spell's maximum range, if the target has moved away.        |

### Spell Casting
If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you can’t cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action

### Potions
When using a potion in combat as: 
* **An Action:** You will benefit from the full effect of the potion, e.g. Potion of Healing (2d4+2) = 10hp 
* **A Bonus Action:** You will roll the attributed dice to determine the effect of the potion, e.g. Potion of Healing (2d4+2) = (3 + 1) + 2 = 6hp


### Death Saving Throws
To add suspense to combat, the DM will make all Death Saving rolls behind the DM screen for ALL characters, including NPCs and Player Characters.
 
### Initiating Sudden Combat
Sometimes all participants are aware of each other at the beginning of an encounter, but one side takes an action or launches an attack while others' guards are down. In this case, no one is surprised, but the DM may allow the instigating creature or party to roll initiative with advantage.

  
### Flanking
When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.
**A creature who is currently considered Flanked can not provide Flanking Advantage.**



### Downed and Up
If a creature is reduced to zero hitpoints and becomes unconscious, when the creature is stabilized/healed it gains a level of exhaustion.


### Overexherting yourself
When times are tough, you may opt to overexert yourselves to complete a physical act or one that requires a force of will, including (but not limited to)
* Make an additional attack
* Doubling a damage roll
* Running that little bit further/faster
* Re-Roll to maintain a Concentration Spell

After the action is complete the the player receives 1 level of Exhaustion. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1) per long rest


### Additional Action Options
This section provides new action options for combat as per DMG: pg 271
#### Climb onto a Bigger Creature
If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.

As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check contested by the target's Dexterity ([Acrobatics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

#### Disarm
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

#### Mark
This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.

When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition or the [shocking grasp](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/shocking-grasp.md) spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.

#### Overrun
When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

#### Shove Aside
With this option, a creature uses the special [shove](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#shove) attack from the "Player's Handbook" to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.

#### Tumble
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ([Acrobatics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity ([Acrobatics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.
