# Detecting & Identifying Magic Items

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic.

Detecting the magical nature of an item works the same as detecting magic generally. Magic items can sometimes be sensed by holding or being in close proximity to them, but it is more common for their magical nature to be hidden, in which case an [[Arcana - Intelligence]] check is required. [[Arcana - Intelligence]] checks can only be retried once per short or long rest until successful.

| DC Value | Difficulty                    |

| **10**   | To determine that it is magic |
| **15**   | To learn its properties       |
There are other ways to learn about magic items.

Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a ring of feather falling.

Wearing or Experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties, and a little taste of a potion is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

The Identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties.
