## Improvised Weapons

Sometimes you won’t have your weapons ready at hand. An improvised weapon includes a tankard, a wagon tongue, or a dead (or alive!) creature that you can lift and wield as a weapon.

At the Narrator’s discretion, an improvised weapon that is **similar to a weapon** with the simple property may be **treated as a simple weapon**. For example, the leg of a table might be used as a club. 

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals **1d4** damage of a type determined by the Narrator. Improvised thrown weapons have a normal range of 20 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet.
