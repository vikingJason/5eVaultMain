## Donning, Doffing, Sizing, and Sleeping in Armor

Armor is typically fitted to its wearer. When you first acquire a set of armor, if it is nonmagical you must make or pay for alterations. Making the alterations yourself requires tool proficiencies as if you were repairing the armor. If the armor is not appropriately sized to you but is of your size category, you must make a DC 12 Constitution [saving throw](https://a5e.tools/rules/saving-throw "Click to view a local node.") at the end of each day, acquiring a level of fatigue on a failure. You may alter armor that is a size category larger than you are, but you cannot fit into armor that is too small—a Medium human could trim down an ogre’s breastplate, but could not resize a halfling’s full plate to fit their larger form. 

It is assumed that cloth armor is worn under breastplates and suits of mail. Aside from cloth, leather, and hide, armor is too rigid and uncomfortable for a restful night’s sleep. If you sleep in medium or heavy armor other than hide, you are roughing it, you regain half the usual number of Hit Dice, and if you have any levels of [fatigue](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") or [strife](https://a5e.tools/rules/conditions "Click to view a local node.") neither is reduced upon finishing the [long rest](https://a5e.tools/rules/resting "Click to view a local node.") (see Chapter 7: Adventuring).  

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on armor. Your Armor Class is only increased by armor that you have fully donned.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.
