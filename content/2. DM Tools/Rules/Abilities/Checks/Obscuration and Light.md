## Obscuration

### Lightly Obscured
In a lightly obscured area, such as **dim light**, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on [[Perception - Wisdom]] checks that rely on sight.

### Heavily Obscured
A **heavily obscured** area—such as **darkness**, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the [[Blinded]] condition.
