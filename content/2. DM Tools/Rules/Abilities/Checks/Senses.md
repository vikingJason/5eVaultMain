## Vision

### Blindsight

Blindsight enables a creature to perceive their surroundings as well as a sighted creature yet without using visual senses. Senses that could contribute to a creature's overall blindsight included enhanced hearing, an acute sense of smell, sensitivity to vibrations, or such specialized senses as echolocation. Because the sense of sight is not involved, a creature with blindsight is not hindered by such spell effects as Invisibility or Darkness.

### Darkvision

Darkvision enables a character to see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it was bright light. In darkness, at least some light is necessary for dark vision to function.

If the light is dim enough as to be very near darkness, a character's darkvision may be limited in the DM's discretion.

### Soulsight

Demons have a special sense called soulsight, allowing them to perceive each creature, other than Constructs and Undead, within a certain radius. Soulsight doesn't rely on sight but counts as "seeing" for features that require sight. Neither physical objects (including total cover) nor supernatural effects can impede soulsight unless otherwise stated.

### Tremorsense

A creature with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks, have this special sense.

### Truesight

Truesight enables a creature to see in normal and magical Darkness, see [[Invisible]] Creatures and Objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on Saving Throws against them, and perceives the original form of a Shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic out to a specific range. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.
