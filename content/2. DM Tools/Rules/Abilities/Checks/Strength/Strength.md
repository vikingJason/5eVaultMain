# Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

## Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

**Carrying Capacity.** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.

**Push, Drag, or Lift.** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

**Size and Strength.** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

## Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The [[Athletics - Strength|Athletics]] skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

### Other Strength Checks

The DM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

#### Easy

- Force open a stuck or broken door
- Break free from weak bindings
- Pull a stuck or wedged object loose

#### Moderate

- Break through a wooden door reinforced with iron
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it

#### Hard

- Break through a heavy locked or barred door
- Topple a stone statue

#### Very Hard

- Break through a heavy reinforced door such as a prison or armory door
- Hold a door shut against a room filling with water
