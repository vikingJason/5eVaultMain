# Athletics

Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

| DC Value | Difficulty        |
| -------- | ----------------- |
|**10** |Climb a rock face with obvious hand and footholds; climb a secured rope|
|**15** |Climb a ship’s rigging in inclement weather; climb a cliffside|
|**18** |Jump from a moving carriage to another; stay on a horse as it makes a daring jump|
|**20** |Long jump while carrying a Medium or Small creature; climb an overhang|

### Automatic
- Climb a wall with plenty of handholds or a secure, knotted rope or rope ladder; swim in relatively calm water
- Jump a number of feet horizontally equal to half of your Strength score, or your full Strength score with a 10 foot running start
- Leap into the air a number of feet equal to half of (3 + your Strength modifier), or the full amount with a 10 foot running start

### Easy
- Climb a wall lacking an adequate amount of handholds
- Tread water in rough conditions
- jump a few feet farther than you normally could
- during a long jump, clear an obstacle such as a low-lying hedge or wall of height ≤ a fourth of the jump’s distance

### Moderate
- Climb a rope dangling from a protrusion or overhang (i.e. Lacking a vertical surface to brace against)
- Swim in rough water or against a mild current.
- Climb a wall with very few handholds

### Hard
- Catch yourself on a rope or other handhold in the middle or at the end of your jump
- Swim in violent water or against a strong current

### Very Hard
- Climb a slippery or sheer wall with little or no handholds
- Climb vertically along an overhang with adequate handholds
- Swim in stormy waters
