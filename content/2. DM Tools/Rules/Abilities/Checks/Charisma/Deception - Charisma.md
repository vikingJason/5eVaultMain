# Deception

Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions.

This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.

Deception is usually contested by a creature’s passive Insight. The following modifiers are appropriate.

| DC Value | Difficulty        |
| -------- | ----------------- |
|**–2** |Victim wants to believe the lie, as it’s convenient or beautiful|
|**–2** |Victim trusts the liar deeply and implicitly|
|**+2** |Victim stands to lose something from the lie|
|**+4** |Victim is undertaking serious risk by believing the lie|
|**+10** |Lie is far-fetched, and the victim would be a fool to take it at face value|


### **Contest vs. Wisdom**
  - Fast-talk or con someone
  - adopt a disguise or impersonate another creature
  - tell a convincing lie or otherwise hide your true intentions
