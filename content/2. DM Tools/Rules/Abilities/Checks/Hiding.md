# **Hiding**

The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. Also, the question isn't whether a creature can see you when you are hiding. The question is whether it can see you clearly.

When you try to hide, make a [[Stealth - Dexterity]] check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the [[Perception - Wisdom]]) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.

There’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. The [[Stealth - Dexterity]] check is contested by the creature's Passive Perception score.

You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.

An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet. In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.

One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be [[Obscuration and Light#Lightly Obscured|lightly]] or [[Obscuration and Light#Heavily Obscured|heavily]] obscured.
