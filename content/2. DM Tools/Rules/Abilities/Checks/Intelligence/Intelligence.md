# Intelligence

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

## Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The [[Arcana - Intelligence]], [[History - Intelligence]], [[Investigation - Intelligence]], [[Nature - Intelligence]], and [[Religion - Intelligence]] skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.

### Other Intelligence Checks

The DM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Communicate with a creature without using words
- Estimate the value of a precious item
- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard
- Forge a document
- Recall lore about a craft or trade
- Win a game of skill

## Spellcasting Ability - Intelligence

Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
