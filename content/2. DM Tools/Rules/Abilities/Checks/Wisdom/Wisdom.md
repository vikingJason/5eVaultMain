# Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.

## Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someoneâ€™s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The [[Animal Handling - Wisdom]], [[Insight - Wisdom]], [[Medicine - Wisdom]], [[Perception - Wisdom]], and [[Survival - Wisdom]] skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

### Other Wisdom Checks

The DM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
- Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead


## Spellcasting Ability - Wisdom

Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.
