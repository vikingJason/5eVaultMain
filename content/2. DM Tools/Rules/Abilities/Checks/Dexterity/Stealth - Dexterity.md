# Stealth

Make a Stealth check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.

Stealth is almost always contested by the passive Perception of the creature you’re hiding from. The following modifiers are appropriate.

| DC Value | Difficulty        |
| -------- | ----------------- |
|**–2** |The hider is wearing distinctive or bright garments|
|**–2** |The area is still and there’s little movement otherwise|
|**+2** |The hider is wearing common or subdued garments|
|**+2** |The area is active and there are distractions|

### **Contest vs Wisdom**
  - Conceal yourself from enemies
  - sneak past unsuspecting targets
  - slip away while others are distracted
