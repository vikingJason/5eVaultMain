# Dexterity

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

## Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.

## Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The [[Acrobatics - Dexterity]], [[Sleight of Hand - Dexterity]], and [[Stealth - Dexterity]] skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.

### Other Dexterity Checks

The DM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
- Steer a chariot around a tight turn
- Pick a lock
- Disable a trap
- Securely tie up a prisoner
- Wriggle free of bonds
- Play a stringed instrument
- Craft a small or detailed object
