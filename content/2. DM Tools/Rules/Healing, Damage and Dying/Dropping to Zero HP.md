# Dropping to Zero HP
When a creature drops to 0 Hit Points, it either dies outright or falls unconscious, as explained below.

## Instant Death
Here are the main ways a creature can die instantly.

### Monster Death
A monster dies the instant it drops to 0 Hit Points, although a Dungeon Master can ignore this rule for an individual monster and treat it like a character.

### Hit Point Maximum of 0
A creature dies if its Hit Point maximum reaches 0. Certain effects drain life energy, reducing a creatureâ€™s Hit Point maximum.

### Massive Damage
When damage reduces a character to 0 Hit Points and damage remains, the character dies if the remainder equals or exceeds their Hit Point maximum. For example, if your character has a Hit Point maximum of 12, currently has 6 Hit Points, and takes 18 damage, the character drops to 0 Hit Points, but 12 damage remains. The character then dies, since 12 equals their Hit Point maximum.
