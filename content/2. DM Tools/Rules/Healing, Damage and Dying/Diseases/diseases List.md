# Diseases

## Arcane Blight
_Source: Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden p. 233_

Any humanoid that spends 12 hours in the necropolis must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract an arcane blight. This magical disease transforms the humanoid into a [nothic](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/nothic.md), but only after the victim experiences hallucinations and feelings of isolation and paranoia. Other symptoms include clammy skin, hair loss, and myopia (nearsightedness).

A player character infected with the arcane blight gains the following flaw: "I don't trust anyone." This flaw, which supersedes any conflicting flaw, is fed by delusions that are difficult for the character to distinguish from reality. Common delusions include the belief that that allies are conspiring to steal the victim's riches or otherwise turn against the victim.

Whenever it finishes a long rest, an infected humanoid must repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for future saves against the arcane blight drops by `1d6`. If the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature overcomes the arcane blight and becomes immune to the effect of further exposure. A creature that fails three of these saving throws transforms into a [nothic](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/nothic.md) under the DM's control. Only a [wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention can undo this transformation.

A [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic ends the infection on the target, removing the flaw and all other symptoms, but this magic doesn't protect the target against further exposure.

## Arcane Wasting
_Source: Tome of Beasts p. 215_

An outbreak of arcane wasting is always met with horror, but that fear is felt tenfold by practitioners of magic both arcane and divine.

When the bodily fluid of an infected creature touches a humanoid or when an infected creature casts a spell (direct or indirect) on a humanoid, that humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with arcane wasting. Beginning `1d6` days after infection, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. If the saving throw fails, the victim loses `1d3` Intelligence and `1d3` Wisdom. Lost Intelligence and Wisdom can't be recovered while the disease persists. If the saving throw succeeds, nothing happens; the disease ends after the second consecutive successful saving throws. Once the disease ends, lost Intelligence and Wisdom can be restored by [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) or comparable magic. The disease is also cured by [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) if the caster makes a successful DC 15 spellcasting check.

## Bilge Bules
_Source: Game Master's Toolbox: Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde p. 126_

This disease causes quick and painful localized swelling. While seldom fatal, it is debilitating in the short-term, and can be used by okiti to make good their escape (as well has have a laugh at the expense of those affected). Okiti fill vials and pots with a gaseous agent containing the disease. A creature exposed to the toxic cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

Once infected, the creature breaks out in a distracting, itchy rash and has disadvantage on saving throws.

Every hour, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against the disease. After 3 successful saves, the creature is cured.

A failed save causes painful swelling to develop; roll a `1d6` and consult the table to determine its location and effects. If the creature already suffers from the effect rolled, it instead takes `1d4` bludgeoning damage.

`dice: [](diseases.md#^location-and-effect)`

| dice: d6 | Location and Effect |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Throat–You cannot speak properly. Every time you attempt to cast a spell with a verbal component, roll a `d20`. On a 5 or lower, the casting fails and the spell slot is expended. |
| 2 | Chest–You suffer one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). |
| 3 | Arms–You have disadvantage on skill checks and attack rolls using your arms. |
| 4 | Hands–You may only use one hand to hold a weapon or shield. |
| 5 | Legs–You have disadvantage on skill checks and attack rolls using your legs. |
| 6 | Feet–Your speed is reduced by 10 feet. |

## Blinding Sickness
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded).

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Blinding Sickness
_Source: Pathfinder: Kingmaker Bestiary (5e) p. 37_

Creatures that take damage from the [Elder Elemental Tsunami's](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/elder-elemental-tsunami-pkb.md) slam or surge must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract blinding sickness. A creature with blinding sickness must repeat the saving throw at the end of each long rest, gaining one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) on a failure or reducing its [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level from this disease by one on a success. [Exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) from blinding sickness can't be removed while the disease continues. A creature that reaches three levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) from blinding sickness is permanently [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded).

## Blue Mist Fever
_Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 40_

A magical mist creeps through the jungles of Chult. Contact with this thin, blue, odorless mist can infect giants and humanoids with blue mist fever. A [dispel magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell destroys the mist in a 20-foot square starting at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range. An encounter with this mist typically covers `1d6` such areas (400-2,400 square feet).

A giant or humanoid that comes into contact with the mist must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with blue mist fever. An infected creature begins seeing vivid hallucinations of blue monkeys `1d6` hours after failing the save, and the hallucinations last until the disease ends on the creature. A creature can repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Bluerot
_Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 234_

This disease targets humanoids. While afflicted with bluerot, a victim grows grotesque blue boils on their face and back. This disease is carried by undead (including the drowned ones in Tammeraut's Fate), and victims most often acquire it through wounds caused by infected creatures. The disease's boils manifest in `1d4` hours, causing the victim's Constitution and Charisma scores to decrease by `1d4` each, to a minimum of 3. This is quickly followed by a fever and tingling in the extremities. An infected creature is vulnerable to radiant damage and gains the ability to breathe underwater.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a success, the victim regains 1 point of Constitution and 1 point of Charisma lost to the disease. If the infected creature regains all the points lost to the disease, it is cured. Other effects that raise the victim's ability scores do not cure the disease. On a failed saving throw, the victim takes 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage as the boils burst and spread. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage cannot regain hit points until the disease is cured, though it can be stabilized as normal.

## Bog Rot
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 Lairs p. 309_

Until the disease is cured, the infected creature's skin breaks out in a rot-like rash that slowly spreads across its body, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 (`2d6`) for every 24 hours that elapse. After the first 24 hours, the creature's skin starts to smell like rot, and creatures have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) and Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks to find the infected creature. The reduction and rot smell last until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.

## Bonerot
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 Lairs p. 299_

An infected creature develops the first symptoms of general weakness and lethargy within 1 hour as its bones start to rot from the inside. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its Strength and Dexterity scores are each reduced by `1d4` and its walking speed is reduced by 5 feet. The reductions last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Strength or Dexterity to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the disease recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

## Cackle Fever
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: "the shrieks."

Symptoms manifest `1d4` hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that can't be removed until the disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (`1d10`) psychic damage and becomes [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition on a success. Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by `1d6`. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of [Madness](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/madness.md).

## Carrion Curse
_Source: Expanding Codex p. 92_

Within a day, a dark discoloration around the wound is accompanied by the smell of putrefying flesh. Unless serious measures are taken to mask the smell, carrion eaters of all kinds will be drawn to the infected creature, gaining advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks to track the creature by smell within their usual range.

While infected with carrion curse, a creature can't be healed magically and can only heal naturally through rest and by spending hit dice. At the end of each long rest, a creature infected with carrion curse must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). If an infected creature succeeds on the saving throw, it no longer gains [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) levels each day. A second successful save at the end of a long rest cures the disease. The abyssal disease resists many efforts at treatment and can only be cured by a [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

A living creature that dies from the effects of carrion curse has a 75% chance chance of rising again as a [blood zombie](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/blood-zombie-ccodex.md) within 24 hours.

## Catscratch Fugue
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 Lairs p. 58_

Catscratch fugue is a bacterial infection that only affects felids and feline humanoids. This infectious organism is carried by debris falling into the Material Plane from the Void and is transmitted either through contact with the crash site or by being bitten by a carrier.

Upon contact, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Once the host is infected, catscratch fugue incubates inside it for 3 days. During this window, the victim's skin itches, and they are prone to violent mood swings. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature can repeat the saving throw, recovering from the disease on a success. A [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell cast during the incubation time cures the disease.

After the third day, if the infection is still present, any negative emotion causes the victim to transform into a monstrous [catscratch](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/catscratch-tob2.md) intent on destroying everything around it. Only a [wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell can cure a [catscratch](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/catscratch-tob2.md) once it has transformed.

## Creeping Cold
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 Lairs p. 371_

At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each day or take 9 (`2d8`) cold damage and 5 (`2d4`) necrotic damage and suffer one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) if the creature has no levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) and hp maximum reduction last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's hp maximum to 0, the creature dies, and it rises as a winterghast `1d4` hours later. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the diseases recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

## Crone's Disease
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 62, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 26_

Perhaps reflective of their spiteful nature in life, hags continue to display an unmatched level of vindictiveness even in death. Upon their death, a reaction takes place immediately in the bodily fluids of a hag that makes them a vector for transmitting "Crone's Disease." Whenever a creature imbibes any bodily fluids from a deceased hag, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with crone's disease. A character whose harvesting check fails to harvest anything from the hag also runs the risk of contracting crone's disease as they clumsily splash blood in an orifice or in an open wound.

Upon contracting crone's disease, 1 of the victim's facial features/body parts immediately transforms to look more hag like. For example, their nose may become hooked, or their hands become claw-like. Every 24 hours, the victim may attempt the saving throw again. On a success, the disease ends, and every 24 hours subsequently, 1 transformed feature returns to normal. On a failure, another facial feature or body part changes to become more hag-like, and the disease continues. Every 7 days, any currently transformed feature becomes permanent even after the disease is cured. At that point, only restorative magic such as that of the spell [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) may return the creature to their normal appearance.

## Daemonic Pestilence
_Source: Pathfinder: Kingmaker Bestiary (5e) p. 30_

A creature likely contracts daemonic pestilence from being attacked by or in close proximity to a [leukodaemon](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/leukodaemon-pkb.md). A creature that starts its turn within 50 feet of a [leukodaemon](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/leukodaemon-pkb.md) must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract daemonic pestilence. A creature with this disease establishes a telepathic link with the [leukodaemon](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/leukodaemon-pkb.md) that conferred this disease. The range of this mental connection is unlimited, even spanning across planes. The creature must also make a Constitution saving throw each day after a long rest, gaining a level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) instead of recovering one on a failure. Daemonic pestilence persists until the target accrues 6 successes against the disease.

## Darakhul Fever
_Source: Tome of Beasts p. 215_

Spread mainly through bite wounds, this rare disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. A creature so afflicted must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. Failure costs the victim `1d6` Constitution damage and `1d4` Dexterity damage. The victim recovers from the disease by making successful saving throws on two consecutive days, but the accumulating Constitution damage makes this less likely with each passing day. [Greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) cures the disease; cure disease allows the victim to make the daily Constitution check with advantage. Once the disease is cured, the victim recovers 2 Dexterity points per day naturally, but only magic can restore the lost Constitution.

Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect ogres, and therefore other giants may be susceptible.

If the infected creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll `d20`, add the character's current Constitution modifier, and find the result on the Adjustment Table to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

**Adjustment Table**

| d20 + <span title='default=1, min=1'>[Constitution Modifier]</span> | Result |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1-9 | None, victim is simply dead |
| 10-16 | [Ghoul](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) |

## Darakhul Fever
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 Lairs p. 167_

Spread mainly through bite wounds, this disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. An infected creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save, the victim takes 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the victim finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The victim recovers from the disease by making two consecutive successful saving throws. [Greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) cures the disease, while [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) gives the victim advantage on the next saving throw.

Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect [ogres](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/giant/ogre.md), and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If a creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll a `d20`, add the character's Constitution modifier, and find the result on the table below to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

| Roll | Result |
|------|--------|
| 1–9 | None; victim is simply dead |
| 10–16 | [Ghoul](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) |
| 17–20 | [Ghast](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/ghast.md) |
| 21+ | Darakhul |

## Filth Fever
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Flesh Rot
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Frenzy
_Source: Game Master's Toolbox: Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde p. 44_

This disease affects the nervous systems of many creatures, altering their behavior over time to become more aggressive and unpredictable. Rock gnolls carry a particularly virulent strain. Infected creatures begin showing symptoms after `1d4` days, including headaches and increased thirst. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, and requires twice the usual amount of water each day.

At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one. If this reduces the level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) to zero, the creature is cured.

A failed save increases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one and the disease intensifies. After one failed save, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw whenever it is placed in a stressful situation or spend its turn making a melee attack against the nearest creature, moving up to its speed if necessary. The DC for this saving throw increases by 2 for each level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) above 1. If the infected creature has 4 levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) (hit points halved), its mind is consumed by the disease and it reverts to an animalistic and wild state, attacking any who come near it. Until the disease can be cured, the creature's Intelligence is reduced by 10 (minimum 3).

## Frigid Woe
_Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 125_

Frigid woe is a special disease developed by Aeor's mages that cannot be cured by conventional treatment or magic. The only way a creature infected with the disease can be cured is by finding and drinking the manufactured antidote, a milky liquid stored in gold vials found in Eiselcross's ruins. This disease was created to slow down the forces of the gods and get around the healing power of their clerics and angels.

The disease is transmitted by breathing in blue spores that Aeor's mages created long ago. When a creature comes into contact with these spores, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with frigid woe. It takes `1d4` days for the symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. These symptoms include fatigue, chills, and visible blue veins that appear on the creature's body. The infected creature's speed is reduced by 5 feet as long as it remains infected. Every 10 days after symptoms appear, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is reduced by another 5 feet. If a creature's speed is reduced to 0 as a result of this disease, the creature dies and its body turns into a statue made of ice.

A creature can drink the antidote as an action, ending all symptoms and effects of the disease instantly.

## Ghoul Gut
_Source: The Orrery of the Wanderer p. 111_

Water polluted with ghoul parts carries ghoul gut. A creature drinking this tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the disease. Symptoms strike when a victim starts a long rest or next becomes excited, as during combat. A victim suffers severe cramps, and their bowels make sounds like two ghouls fighting. When the symptoms first strike, the victim takes 5 (`2d4`) necrotic damage. In addition, a diseased victim regains no hit points or Hit Dice from nonmagical sources, including resting or spending Hit Dice. A victim who finishes a long rest can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the victim shakes off the disease. Failure deals the character another 5 (`2d4`) necrotic damage.

A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check can also remove the disease from another creature. Doing so requires the character making the check to care for the sick individual during a long rest. The caregiver gains no benefit from that rest.

## Gnoll's Kiss
_Source: Game Master's Toolbox: Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde p. 34_

This disease may have originated as an okiti weapon, but has since grown and mutated in the gutter gnolls' filthy habitat into a particularly nasty affliction.Tales of ghouls in the sewers often spring up around the horribly scarred, or even entirely skinless,corpses it leaves behind. Infected creatures begin showing symptoms after`1d4` days, including itchiness and sores. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), and becomes vulnerable to poison and acid damage while infected.

At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one. If this reduces the level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) to zero, the creature is cured.

A failed save increases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one as its sores begin to worsen and weep, dealing `1d10` poison damage for each level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). If this damage reduces the creature's hit points to 0, its skin is entirely covered in open wounds and large areas begin to slough off, killing it through a combination of shock and dehydration.

## Goblin Pox
_Source: Pathfinder: Kingmaker Bestiary (5e) p. 49_

A creature exposed to goblin pox must succeed on a DC 11 (dog) or DC 12 (bat-dog) Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with goblin pox. On a successful saving throw, it is immune to goblin pox for 24 hours.

A creature with goblin pox is [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) and must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failed save, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its turns, but not both. The creature can then repeat the saving throw after each long rest, ending the effects on itself on a success. Goblins and [goblin dogs](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/goblin-dog-pkb.md) are immune to goblin pox.

## Goblin's Trumpet
_Source: Game Master's Toolbox: Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde p. 76_

It takes `1d4` days for the infected creature to start showing symptoms, which include shortness of breath and increased sensitivity to sunlight. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), and has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight when it or whatever it is trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one. If this reduces the level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) to zero, the creature is cured.

A failed save increases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one and the disease intensifies. After one failed save, the creature has a strong desire to surround itself with as many creatures as possible. After two failed saves, the creature becomes more irritable and violent. If the infected creature has 4 levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) (hit points halved), spines of fungus erupt from its body, killing it, and the fungus takes full control of the creature's corpse. It gains the Explosive Death trait and Bite and Vomit Spores attacks from the afflicted [cave goblin's stat block](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/cave-goblin-roth.md) .

## Grackle-Lung
_Source: Out of the Abyss p. 54_

The constant smog in Gracklstugh causes grackle-lung in living, breathing creatures, resulting in persistent, wracking coughs and the spewing of thick, black phlegm. Whenever a living, breathing creature finishes a long rest in Gracklstugh, it must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On each failed save, the creature gains one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) as its airways become increasingly clogged. A creature that reaches level 6 [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) dies, as normal.

A creature with one or more levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) brought on by grackle-lung must succeed on a Constitution check to take the [Dash](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action. If the check fails, the action cannot be attempted. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, it must succeed on a Constitution check or be unable to complete the spell, causing the spell to fail with no effect. The DC for each check is 10 + the creature's current [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level.

If a creature's [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level drops below 1, it no longer suffers the effects of grackle-lung and becomes immune to it for the next week. Duergar and derro are inured to grackle-lung, making Constitution checks against it with advantage. Any spell or effect that cures disease also cures grackle-lung, effectively removing all levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) brought on by the affliction.

## Gut Rot
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 129_

While afflicted with gut rot, any time you attempt to swallow food, you instead suffer `4` necrotic damage and regurgitate that food. At the end of a long rest, you may attempt the saving throw again, ending the disease on a success.

If a creature dies while afflicted with gut rot, a [violet fungus](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/violet-fungus.md) sprouts from the mouldering corpse, growing to full size in `2d6` days.

## Influence of Zuggtmoy
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 105_

While infected in this way, the creature is [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you and can't be reinfected by these spores.

## Iumenta Pox
_Source: Expanding Codex p. 395_

It takes `1d4` days for iumenta pox's symptoms to appear in an infected humanoid. A creature with iumenta pox has trouble breathing, and its skin erupts with painful green boils that ooze pus. As the disease progresses, these pustules turn black.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage. The creature's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. When an infected creature dies, its corpse rises as a mold zombie `1d4` hours after death. Iumenta pox can be cured with two successful saving throws.

## Mindfire
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [confusion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell during combat.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Ooze Plague
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 Lairs p. 297_

Until the disease is cured, the infected creature's skin slowly becomes more ooze-like, and its hp maximum decreases by 5 (`2d4`) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this disease rises 24 hours later as an [ochre jelly](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md).

## Ophio Spores
_Source: Tome of Beasts 2 Lairs p. 158_

This disease affects humanoids who breathe. The eyes of infected creatures become glassy, and purple bruising appears on their spines, bulging as the disease progresses. At the end of each long rest after infection, an infected creature is wracked by terrible dreams or visions and must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that can't be removed until the disease is cured. After the creature has two levels of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), it moves to the second stage of the infection. During the first stage of infection, a [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic ends the infection.

At the end of each long rest after the creature reaches the second stage of infection, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become a thrall of the ophio fungus, falling completely under its control. A victim in the second stage of the infection or that is completely under the fungus' control can be restored only by killing the fungus that caused the infection or through the use of a [wish](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish.md) spell.

## Red Death
_Source: Game Master's Toolbox: Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde p. 126_

This disease causes internal bleeding and makes it difficult for the blood to clot, usually causing a swift and painful death. Okiti fill vials and pots with a gaseous agent containing the disease, using it as an extreme, but short term deterrent; the disease is usually too fast-acting to spread very far. A creature who breathes in the toxic cloud, or who comes into contact with an infected creature's bodily fluids must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes `1d4` minutes for the infected creature to start manifesting symptoms, which include severe stomach cramps. The infected creature has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws which rely on Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

Every hour, the infected creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw against the disease. After 3 successful saves, the creature is cured.

A failed save worsens the internal bleeding, causing the creature to suffer one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) and reducing the creature's hit point maximum by `3d10` until the creature is cured of the disease. While the creature's hit points are reduced, it is also vulnerable to slashing damage, as even the tiniest nick bleeds profusely.

## Redface
_Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 168_

The effects of redface are identical to those of sight rot (see ""Diseases"" in chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"), but it's caused by pollutants in the air rather than contaminated drinking water, making it difficult to avoid.

## Rotbones
_Source: Game Master's Toolbox: Ultimate Bestiary: Revenge of the Horde p. 134_

This disease, weaponized by the okiti, causes the flesh around the victim's extremities, or the site of infection, to rot and become necrotic. It is often fatal, and even those who survive can be permanently scarred and weakened. Okiti sometimes coat their weapons with a solution tainted with rotbones, or infect wells and food stores. A creature exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes `1d4` hours for the infected creature to start showing symptoms, which include muscle cramps and fever. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against the disease. A successful save decreases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one, and if this reduces the level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) to zero, the creature is cured.

A failed save increases its level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) by one and its flesh begins to turn black, dealing `1d10` necrotic damage for each level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). This damage cannot be healed until the creature is cured of the disease. For every 30 points of damage taken in this way, the creature's Constitution score is reduced by 1. Lost Constitution can only be restored by the [Greater Restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

## Saprophytic Plague
_Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 253_

Xanthoria's research into lichdom and her creation of a living phylactery led to the emergence of the plague spreading across the Sword Coast. Any beast or humanoid that comes within 10 feet of a creature infected by the saprophytic plague must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or become infected as well. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the plague for 24 hours, and any creature that is immune to disease succeeds on the save automatically.

After a failed save, a creature experiences the first symptoms—body aches, nausea, slurred speech, and uncontrollable drooling—`1d4` hours later and gains 1 level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). Every 24 hours thereafter, the creature automatically gains another level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). Any creature killed by the saprophytic plague transforms into a lifeless magenta ooze.

A creature infected by the saprophytic plague for at least 24 hours behaves like a zombie and seems barely aware of its surroundings, as fungal growths sprout from its head, body, and limbs. It feels an overriding urge to be around groups of uninfected creatures so that it can spread the contagion. This is the time when infected humanoids begin speaking the word "Xanthoria" over and over, with no understanding of what the word means. This behavior is the result of a mycelial network of spores that forms a tenuous connection between Xanthoria and humanoids that become infected by the plague.

Foodstuffs that are exposed to the plague's spores decay or go sour within `2d12` hours, leaving behind a lurid magenta mass of oozing fungi. Eating infected food requires a saving throw as above.

Any magic that cures a disease can rid a creature of the saprophytic plague. Casting [purify food and drink](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/purify-food-and-drink.md) destroys the infection in foodstuffs.

## Seeping Death
_Source: Expanding Codex p. 288_

At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by `1d4`. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies and its body becomes a [suppurating ooze](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/suppurating-ooze-ccodex.md) `1d4` hours later. The disease lasts until removed by the [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or other similar magic.

## Seizure
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Sewer Plague
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.

It takes `1d4` days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

On a successful save, the character's [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

## Shivering Sickness
_Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 40_

Insects native to the jungles and marshes of Chult carry this disease, shivering sickness. The easiest protection against it is a coating of insect-repelling salve on all exposed skin (for the cost of insect repellent, see "Buying a Special Item".

A giant or humanoid that takes damage from [insect swarms](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-insects.md) or from [giant centipedes](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-centipede.md), [giant scorpions](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md), or [giant wasps](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-wasp.md) is exposed to the disease at the end of the encounter. Those who haven't applied insect repellent since their previous long rest are exposed to the disease when they finish a long rest.

A giant or humanoid exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected. A creature with natural armor has advantage on the saving throw. It takes `2d6` hours for symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include blurred vision, disorientation, and a sudden drop in body temperature that causes uncontrollable shivering and chattering of the teeth.

Once symptoms begin, the infected creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from a long rest. The infected creature also has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. At the end of a long rest, an infected creature repeats the saving throw, shaking off the disease on a successful save.

## Sight Rot
_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 257. Available in the SRD._

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until its sight is restored by magic such as [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) or [heal](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal.md).

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an [herbalism kit](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit.md) can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely.

## Slimy Doom
_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_

The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [stunned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.

> [!note]
> This disease can be inflicted with the [contagion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/contagion.md) spell.

## Spider Eggs
_Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 47_

If the party is defeated, stabilized characters awaken after `1d4` hours to find themselves cocooned in sticky webs and suspended 10 feet off the floor, with spider eggs implanted in their bodies. A cocooned character is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and can use its action to try to escape by making a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Spider eggs implanted in a host hatch in `2d12` hours, killing the host as the baby spiders chew their way out. This infestation functions like a disease. A [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic cast upon the host kills the spider eggs, ending the threat.

## Spores of Zuggtmoy
_Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 105_

While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a "spore servant" if it's a type of creature that can be "(see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual)".

## Super-Tetanus
_Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 104_

A creature that contracts the disease of super-tetanus is wracked with pain as its heart races and its muscles spasm hard enough to break its bones. The creature takes 11 (`2d10`) damage at the start of each of its turns. If a victim is not cured by other means, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every minute after becoming exposed, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.

## The Gnawing Plague
_Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 153_

The Gnawing Plague, also known as "the Gnaws," is known in every corner of Richemulot.

### Transmission

The Gnaws is spread when a creature is bitten by a [rat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/rat.md), [giant rat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-rat.md), [swarm of rats](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rats.md), or [wererat](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) that carries the disease, or by coming into physical contact with an infected creature.

### Infection

Creatures exposed to the disease must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become infected. The DC of this saving throw can increase depending on the severity of the plague's spread (see ""Cycle of the Plague"" below).

### Symptoms

It takes `1d2` days for the Gnawing Plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. The infected creature then gains 1 level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice, and regains no hit points from finishing a long rest.

The plague's symptoms include buboes, fatigue, splotchy rashes, sweats, and shaking, particularly facial tremors. Locals liken these twitches to the sniffing of rats. Sufferers often have scraps of leather placed in their mouths to prevent their teeth from clattering, though they inevitably gnaw through these scraps.

### Recovery

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). On a successful save, the creature's [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level decreases by 1. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

### Immunity

All forms of rats and wererats are immune to the Gnawing Plague.

## The Ravening
_Source: Tome of Beasts 3 Lairs p. 272_

This affliction causes uncontrollable fury, and it can be transmitted by contact with infected fluids or clothing, or by the bite of a [ravening minotaur](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ravening-minotaur-tob3.md). The ravening is highly contagious and can infect giants, humanoids, and monstrosities. A creature exposed to it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Minotaurs have disadvantage on the saving throw.

After 24 hours, the infected creature gains the [ravening minotaur's](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/ravening-minotaur-tob3.md) Ravening Hunger and Ravening Madness traits until cured. If the infected creature is cured after its hp maximum increased from Ravening Hunger, it retains its new hp maximum. After the first 24 hours, a minotaur infected with the ravening can be cured only by the [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar powerful magic. Other creatures can be cured by the [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar disease-ending magic, as normal.

## Throat Leeches
_Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 40_

Minuscule parasites known as throat leeches infect the water in Chult's forests, swamps, and rivers. Any giant or humanoid that swallows tainted water must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infested with throat leeches. Immediate symptoms include throat inflammation and shortness of breath. After `1d6` hours, the infected character gains 1 level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that can't be removed (except as described below) until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) increases by 1 level; on a successful save, the creature's [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) decreases by 1 level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of [exhaustion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.

Explorers can avoid contracting throat leeches by drinking only rainwater or water that's been boiled or magically purified.
