### Arcane Wasting
_Source: Tome of Beasts p. 215_

An outbreak of arcane wasting is always met with horror, but that fear is felt tenfold by practitioners of magic both arcane and divine.

When the bodily fluid of an infected creature touches a humanoid or when an infected creature casts a spell (direct or indirect) on a humanoid, that humanoid must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with arcane wasting. Beginning `1d6` days after infection, the infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each long rest. If the saving throw fails, the victim loses `1d3` Intelligence and `1d3` Wisdom. Lost Intelligence and Wisdom can't be recovered while the disease persists. If the saving throw succeeds, nothing happens; the disease ends after the second consecutive successful saving throws. Once the disease ends, lost Intelligence and Wisdom can be restored by [greater restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md) or comparable magic. The disease is also cured by [lesser restoration](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration.md) if the caster makes a successful DC 15 spellcasting check.
