# Countdowns

Can a climber scale a crumbling cliff before it collapses? Can a thief pick a lock before the magical alarms go off? Can a halfling rogue recover the magic goblet and escape the dragon's lair before it wakes up?

A countdown takes place when there is an unknown time limit before something occurs. A deadly ritual might need to be dispelled, or a room might be filling up with poisonous gas.

The countdown is started by forming a pool of six-sided dice. The Narrator determines the size of that dice pool based on the circumstances.

At the start of each round, the dice pool is rolled. Any dice with a result of 6 are removed from the dice pool, and play continues. The countdown is not immutable: the Narrator might deem that certain actions during the scenario might add or remove a die from the countdown, and there will often be a way to stop it. However, sometimes a countdown cannot be stoppedâ€”the cliff is going to crumble, and you must reach the top before it does!

When the last die is removed from the dice pool the countdown expires.
