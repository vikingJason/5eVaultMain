### Moving Around Other Creatures

During your move, you can pass through the space of an ally, a creature that has the [[Incapacitated]] condition , a Tiny creature, or a creature that is two sizes larger or smaller than you.

Another creature’s space is [[Difficult Terrain]] for you unless that creature is Tiny or your ally.

You can’t willingly end a move in a space occupied by another creature. If you somehow end a turn in a space with another creature, you have the [[Prone]] unless you are Tiny or are of a larger size than the other creature.
