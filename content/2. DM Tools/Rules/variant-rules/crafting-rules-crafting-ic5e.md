# Crafting Rules: Crafting
*Source: Item Crafting Rules for 5e* 

When players have downtime between, or even in the middle of campaigns, it will be the case from time to time that they will want to use their skills to create something, either for themselves, or to sell and turn a profit while they wait out their next big adventure. The rules developed here are designed to provide a more comprehensive method for crafting items, be they magical or mundane, as well as provide the DM with some ability to more precisely gage the value of certain magical items they might provide to their players within their adventures.

## What to Craft?

What is better for making a [quarterstaff](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff.md), [Carpenter's Tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/carpenters-tools.md) or [Woodcarver's Tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/woodcarvers-tools.md)? Ultimately the decision lies with the DM, but the following is a set of guidelines for what each set of tools can be used to do, and the table below indicates the relevant ability score to use in crafting checks with each set of tools.

It should be noted neither the tools nor the proficiency brings with it any structural requirements if they exist. A Smith will still need a forge to properly apply their craft.
