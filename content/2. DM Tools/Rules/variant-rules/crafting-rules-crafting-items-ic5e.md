# Crafting Rules: Crafting Items
*Source: Item Crafting Rules for 5e* 

Once the daily cost, minimum crafting time, and standard value have been determined, the characters can begin crafting their new item. Characters must spend a minimum of 8 continuous hours for the time spent to count toward a crafting day. Multiple days do not have to be done consecutively for them to count however

At the end of each day spent crafting, players must mark off the daily cost, and make a crafting check. The modifier for this check is the same as the Work Rate calculated under [Crafting Rules: Properties](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/variant-rules/crafting-rules-properties-ic5e.md). Once crafting is complete, take the average of all crafting rolls made on that item and compare it to the table below to determine the Quality and value multiplier.

**Item Quality**

| Average | Quality | Value Multiplier |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| 0 - 4 | Ruined | 0x |
| 4.01 - 12 | Shoddy | 0.1x |
| 12.01 - 14 | Poor | 0.5x |
| 14.01 - 17 | Standard | 1x |
| 17.01 - 19 | Superior | 1.2x |
| 19.01 - 21 | Exceptional | 1.5x |
| 21+ | Masterwork | 2x |

Players can get an approximate feel for the Quality of their item during work to decide if they wish to continue working or finish the crafting process; however, the final Quality and Properties are unknown until after the crafting is complete.

> [!note] Aren The Blacksmith
> 
> Aren must spend 10 days working on his Dwarven Steel Greataxe. At the end of each day he makes a Crafting Check with a +6 modifier since he is using his +1 Smithing tools. Using this modifier he rolls the following: 10, 19, 15, 15, 24, 19, 17, 20, 13, 21. This averages to 17.3 making it Superior Quality. This increases the value of the Greataxe to 75 (standard value) x 1.2 (Superior Quality) = 90gp.
