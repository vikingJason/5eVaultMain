# (More Predictable) Wish Spells
*Source: (More Predictible) Wish Spells* 

Wish spells granted to creatures by Celestials, Fiends, and Elementals have their own unique randomization for these effects.

A wish from a djinni, for instance, is much more likely to twist your words to benefit themselves. Celestials are keen on giving you what you asked for with no strings attached, and devils work to cause suffering and death to those who use their wishes.

Regardless of what you wish for, wish is a volatile spell that shouldn't be taken lightly. Your best bet for success is to word your wish carefully and hope for the best.
