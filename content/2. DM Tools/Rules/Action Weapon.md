# Action Weapon (5e Variant Rule)

# Weapon Action Rule

Weapon Actions are a type of Action granted to a character based on the type of weapon they are wielding. For example, bladed weapons such as Longswords will typically grant the Lacerate weapon action.

These actions are only usable once per Short Rest and are special in some way, normally able to do bonus damage, hit multiple targets, debilitate foes, or move the character.

In order to gain access to the Weapon Actions from a weapon, a creature must have Proficiency in that weapon type and have it equipped in the main hand or both hands (off-hand weapons do not grant Weapon Actions).

The Difficulty Class (or DC) for Saving Throws against Weapon Actions is 8 + your strength or dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. It uses the highest strength or dexterity modifier regardless of the ability modifier used for the weapon.
