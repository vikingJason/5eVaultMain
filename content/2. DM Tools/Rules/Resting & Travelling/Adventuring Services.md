**First and Second level** spellscasting services are easy enough to find in a decently sized city or town.  
**Third level** and higher spells are much more rare and can only be found with any amount of regularity in a large city, perhaps home to a University or Temple.
Often times a spellcaster might ask for a service rather than monetary payment.
