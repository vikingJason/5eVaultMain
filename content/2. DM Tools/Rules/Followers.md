# Followers

As adventurers gain fame and experience they start to attract followers. Followers come from all walks of life, from minstrels and cooks to soldiers and sages.

The maximum number of followers you may have is equal to your Prestige rating, increased by any bonuses you might have from owning a stronghold, or as a reward by the Narrator for accomplishing great deeds.

Followers aren’t the same as the general staff which maintains your stronghold. Followers are loyal, dedicated to you and your cause, can accompany you on adventures, and provide benefits while out in the field. A cook can keep you well-nourished and healthy, and a sage can provide knowledge and advice.

Followers never participate directly in encounters. They fade into the background and come to the fore occasionally when their particular skill is needed. Each follower grants a specific ability or benefit.

Adventurers should take care to protect their followers. While they do not feature directly in combat encounters, they can be killed—indeed, a follower is usually killed by a single attack.



## Recruiting Followers

When you recruit a follower, you need to spend gold. In exchange, you get the follower for life. 500 gold recruits an inexperienced follower, 2,000 gold recruits a seasoned follower, and 5,000 gold recruits an expert follower. You only need to pay this once per follower; it is assumed that the amount paid is enough to accommodate the follower for the duration of the campaign. If you dismiss the follower, the Narrator may permit you to reclaim some of that money. If the follower dies, you do not get any money back. Note that not all followers have seasoned or expert versions—carrying a torch isn’t the purview of only experts.

**Inexperienced** (500 gold). Inexperienced followers are little more than commoners foolish enough to follow adventurers into a dungeon.

**Seasoned** (2,000 gold). Seasoned followers have either prior employment with adventurers or other experience that prepared them for adventuring.

**Expert** (5,000 gold). Expert followers are consummate professionals, rare individuals who have had their share of adventures but are comfortable in their role as assistant.
