### Cover

Cover provides a degree of protection to a target behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of which provides a different benefit to a target: 

| Degree         | Benefit to Target                          | Offered By...                                                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Half**           | +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | Another creature or an object that covers at least half of the target |
| **Three-Quarters** | +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws | An object that covers at least three-quarters of the target           |
| **Total**          | Can’t be targeted directly                 | An object that covers the whole target                                |


If behind more than one degree of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree.
