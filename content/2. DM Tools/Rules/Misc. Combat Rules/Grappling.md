###  Grappling

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.

Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a **[[Strength]] ([[Athletics - Strength]]) check contested by the targetâ€™s [[Strength]] ([[Athletics - Strength]]) or [[Dexterity]] ([[Acrobatics - Dexterity]]) check** (the target chooses the ability to use).

If you succeed, you subject the target to the [[Grappled]] condition. The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Escaping a Grapple:** A [[Grappled]] creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a [[Strength]] ([[Athletics - Strength]]) or [[Dexterity]] ([[Acrobatics - Dexterity]]) check contested by your [[Strength]] ([[Athletics - Strength]]) check.

**Moving a Grappled Creature:** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.
