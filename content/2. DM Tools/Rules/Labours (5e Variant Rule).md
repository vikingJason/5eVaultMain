# Labours (5e Variant Rule)
## Preface

Labors, trials, great feats, challenges... No matter what you call them, inspired partially from the 12 Labours of Hercules, labors are a unique set of rules for alternative or supplemental character progression in D&D 5e. Labors are optional, monumental challenges presented to a character to test their abilities or resourcefulness. Successful completion of a labor does not reward a character with treasure, rather, it rewards them with direct growth in their abilities.

### Implementing Labors in Your Campaign

While a campaign where character progression is based entirely around labors is possible, labors are designed to be best implemented as supplemental to normal character progression. Throughout the course of an adventure, characters will naturally encounter and triumph over various monsters. Characters who have knowledge of a labor may capitalize on the opportunity presented by these encounters, challenging themselves and these creatures with self-imposed limitations in order to grow from the experience. Alternatively, some labors require collecting special substances and materials under specific circumstances, and then combining them alchemically or consuming them in a special ritual.

Depending on how much you lean into it, a character may only complete 4 or 5 labors over the course of a campaign, most likely of a difficulty close to a level they can actually attempt. Completing a labor that raises an ability score above 20 might happen perhaps once or twice a campaign, and if it does, it is certainly a monumental moment that that character has earned.

How a character gains knowledge of a labor is up to the DM. Perhaps they are hinted at by previous champions of the world, or by dusty tomes in ancient libraries. Perhaps a [[manual of gainful exercise]], in addition to its usual properties, hints that the heart of a [[tarrasque]] holds great power.

### Designing Labors[[edit](https://www.dandwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Labours*(5e*Variant*Rule)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Designing Labors")]

Labors have a reward proportional to their difficulty of accomplishment, but all labors are intended to be challenging to those who would benefit from them. Usually, labors follow a theme. For example, a labor that increases your [[Strength]] score might involve vanquishing a particularly strong creature in a specific way and consuming one of its body parts. Labors should never provide a relative bonus (+1 or +2 to a stat), we have the tomes and manuals for that. Rather, a labor should set an attribute of a character to a new value, preferably one that matches the attribute of a creature used in the labor.

The bonuses offered by ability score increasing labors should range from 12 to 30, in increments of 2. The justification being that the cap of all ability scores in 5e is 30, and that any labors for ability scores below 10 would not exactly be notable or heroic.

So far labors appear to be able to be divided into two categories:

- Immediate challenges- "kill this thing and eat its heart"
- Long-term tasks- "collect these specific thing(s) and do something with them"

When designing a labor, keep in mind that they should be like mini-quests. And they should be **difficult**. Like the labors of Hercules of myth, which were intended to be impossible, they should toy with the prospect of impossibility. No single dice roll should determine if a character accomplishes a labor or not. Undergoing a labor must be a concentrated effort upheld both by the player, character, and even the DM. Since they offer strong benefits, take care to design them to be difficult/obtuse/specific enough that a character/player has to intentionally go out of their way to perform them, and not simply perform them by accident. This can be done easily enough by breaking the labor into two "steps". For example, in [[#The Heart of a Tarrasque]], you must first **a.** Stop the heart, then **b.** consume a piece of the heart in order to complete the labor.

Additionally, the wording of labors are intended to be vague enough to be open-ended mechanically, but specific enough that a player has a decent idea of what to do. However, it is important to include in the labor something definite that signifies that it has indeed been successfully performed- usually a physical item that the character acquires and uses to complete the labor.

## List of Labors

### Labors of [[Strength]]

Labors of strength are rather straightforward and often involve accomplishing exceptional feats of physical prowess.

#### The Heart of a Tarrasque

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 30.*

You must end the life of a [[Tarrasque]] by stopping its heart using your bare hands alone. Once you do so, you may then consume a piece of the heart, granting you the strength of the tarrasque.

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 28 if it is not already higher.*

You must challenge and defeat a [[Storm Giant]] in a contest of feats of strength. Both you and the storm giant must agree to the rules, and once the storm giant admits your victory, you have proven that your muscles surpass even the might of the giants.

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 24 if it is not already higher.*

Without using magic to assist you, you must challenge and kill an [[Iron Golem]] in single combat. Once you destroy the golem, your body's natural prowess undergoes a transformation, and your very body seems to grow in power as if embodying the golem's strength itself.

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 22 if it is not already higher.*

Without using magic to assist you, you must best and kill a variety of creatures in single combat. You must strangle a [[giant constrictor snake]] to death, kill a [[giant ape]] using your bare hands, and tear the teeth out of a [[giant shark]] before killing it.

#### The Bite of the Bulette

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 18 if it is not already higher.*

You must use your strength to prevent a [[bulette]] from making a successful bite attack against any creatures for 1 minute.

By doing so, you are made certain you now possess the strength that the bulette once had.

#### A Tale of Tails

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 16 if it is not already higher.*

Without using magic to assist you, you must find and tie together the tails of either five living [[tigers]], [[lions]], [[dire wolves]], or [[reef sharks]]. Once they are tied together, you must set the mass loose on an unsuspecting humanoid. Once you perform this deed, you are granted the strength of those natural predators of the wild.

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 14 if it is not already higher.*

*Boon: Your [[Strength]] score becomes 12 if it is not already higher.*

Labors of dexterity often involve feats of precision, speed, and agility.

#### The Wrath of a Tempest[[edit](https://www.dandwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Labours*(5e*Variant*Rule)&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: The Wrath of a Tempest")]

Without using magic to assist you, you must catch and tie together the tails of ten living [[rats]]. Once you do so, the mass of rats becomes a sentient [[rat king]] that curses you in name and immediately tries to escape.

#### The Spleen of an Empyrean

#### Ballad of the Underdog

Your character must begin play with no more than one ability score higher than 11. If you complete at least 5 labors that result in raising three or more of your ability scores to 12 or higher, you realize that an unending determination empowers you to push past your limits no matter what.

#### Beyond Lucky

*Boon: You may add your proficiency bonus to death saving throws and you gain one of the following feats: alert, lucky, or resilient. In addition, when you are subject to an effect that would kill you outright such as massive damage or [[power word kill]], roll a d20. On a 10 or higher, you drop to 0 hit points instead.*

You must participate in and live through each of the following scenarios:

- Becoming the sole survivor of one or more dangerous situations throughout which a total of 4 or more of your allies (other PCs and NPCs with a comparable or greater power level) have perished.
- Coming down to a single roll of the dice with odds of 50/50 or worse that decides whether you live or die.

Once you have defied sheer death so many times, the ability to do so has become natural to you.

*Boon: You can choose to ignore the effects of any curse affecting you. As an action, you can touch a creature and choose one of the following: if it is cursed, you can transfer the curse to yourself; if it is not already cursed, you can force it to make a [[Wisdom]] saving throw (DC 8 + twice your proficiency bonus) and transfer one of your curses to it.*

You must be under the effects of five different curses simultaneously for the duration of one year, at least two of which must be from attuned items. Once this year is up, you must either acquire a sixth curse, or pull one of the following cards from a [[deck of many things]]: Talons, The Void, Flames, Skull, Idiot, Donjon, Ruin, Euryale, Rogue, Balance, or Fool. Whatever it is, it fails to have any effect as the conflux of so much bad juju causes a supernatural twist in the Weave surrounding your soul.

#### A Deadly Concoction

*Boon: You become immune to poison damage and the [[Poisoned]]*

#### Skin of Adamantine, Variant

*Boon: Any critical hit made against you becomes a normal hit.*

While below 100 hit points, you must be struck 5 times by critical hits with a weapon attack from a hostile creature without regaining any hit points or reducing the damage taken. Once the final blow has landed and you remain standing, your skin begins to glisten with the black reflective sheen characteristic of adamantine.

#### Slayer of Dragons

*Boon: You gain the [[boon of the dragon slayer]] "Boon of the Dragon Slayer (5e Epic Boon)") epic boon.*

You must hunt and slay the following dragons singlehandedly, splashing yourself with a pint of blood from each:

- 100 wyrmlings of any type
- 7 young adult dragons, no more than three of the same type
- 5 adult dragons, no more than two of the same type
- 3 ancient dragons, each of a different type

Finally, you must deal the finishing blow to either a greatwyrm, an avatar of Tiamat, or an avatar of Bahamut, and collect one final pint. By bathing yourself in the combined blood of these dragons, you place yourself at the apex of these beings, transforming yourself into an icon of terror deeply ingrained into the minds of dragons everywhere.

To complete this labor, you must spend 24 hours or more in each of the following locations: The Material plane and it's echoes (Feywild and Shadowfell); The four inner planes (Air, Earth, Fire, Water); the 17 outer planes (Elysium, The Beastlands, Arborea, Ysgard, Limbo, Pandemonium, The Abyss, Carceri, Hades, Gehenna, The Nine Hells, Acheron, Mechanus, Arcadia, Mount Celestia, and Bytopia), Sigil, and one realm entirely elsewhere (The Far Realm, another crystal sphere/world, a large demiplane, etc.) Once you have done so, you unlock the ability to walk between worlds as if nothing separated them at all.

#### The Watcher of the Night

*Boon: You gain the vigilant feat and darkvision out to 60 feet.*

You must go for 120 hours without benefiting from a [[Long Rest]], during which you must singlehandedly defeat at least 3 encounters of medium difficulty or higher. Once you do so, you gain a heightened sense of danger and vigilance.
