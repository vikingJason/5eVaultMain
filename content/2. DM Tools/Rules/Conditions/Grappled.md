# Grappled

The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grapple effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the Thunderwave spell.

A grappled creatureâ€™s speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

The condition ends if the grappler is [[Incapacitated]].
