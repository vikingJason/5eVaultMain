# Wounded

There are six levels of wounds, and they work in a similar way to [[Exhaustion]]. Each time you are reduced to 0 hit points, you gain one level of wounds. These wound levels represent significant injuries, like an arrow in your arm, a serious cut, or a club cracking your skull. The more wound levels you have, the more penalties you suffer. Consult the chart below for the effects of wound levels.

The effects of being Wounded stack, just like [[Exhaustion]] does. If you have 2 wound levels, you suffer disadvantage on physical Ability Checks and your [[Movement#Speed|speed]] is halved. The effects of wound levels do not stack with exhaustion levels, however. A character with 2 wound levels and 2 exhaustion levels has their speed halved, not quartered.

| Level |                                                |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1.    | Disadvantage on skill and ability checks       |
| 2.    | [[Movement#Speed\|Speed]] halved               |
| 3.    | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4.    | Hit Pointmen maximum halved                    |
| 5.    | [[Movement#Speed\|Speed]] reduced to zero      |
| 6.    | Death                                          |
