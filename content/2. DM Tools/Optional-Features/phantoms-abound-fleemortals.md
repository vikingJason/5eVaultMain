# Phantoms Abound
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 138*  

**Prerequisite**: Night Hag in a Coven

(Recharge 5-6) The hag fills the area around them with illusions of their enemies' worst fears. Each enemy within 30 feet of the hag must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 22 (`5d8`) psychic damage, falls [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), and if the hag is within 5 feet of the target, the hag can make a Dream Claw attack against them. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage, doesn't fall [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), and the hag doesn't attack them.
