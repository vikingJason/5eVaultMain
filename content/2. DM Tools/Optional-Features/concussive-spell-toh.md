# Concussive Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 125*  

When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature, you can spend 1 sorcery point to push the target of your spell 10 feet away from you. If the spell affects multiple targets, you can choose only one of the targets to be pushed away from you.
