# Impetu
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 258*  

*The rune of strength*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Force

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *impetu* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't force, change the spell's damage type to force. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *impetu* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
