# Solis
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 261*  

*The rune of stars*

**Type**: Duration Rune

**Representation**: 9 hours to 24 hours

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *solis* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a duration of 9 to 24 hours, increase the spell's duration by half. For example, a spell that lasts 8 hours lasts 12 hours when you use this rune as a spellcasting focus. If the spell requires concentration, you must still maintain concentration.
