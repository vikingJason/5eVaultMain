# Memory Thief
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 392*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*4th-Order Metamorphosis Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You plunder the mind of a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `4d10` psychic damage, their proficiency bonus is lowered by 1, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and your power save DC for the duration.

**Increased Order.** When you manifest this power, you can increase its order by 1 or more. For each increase of 1, the damage increases by `2d10`.
