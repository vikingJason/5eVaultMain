# Plant Prison (5 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 39*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

As an action, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Thorny vines erupt from the ground beneath the target, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes `4d6` piercing damage and is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the start of your next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn't [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
