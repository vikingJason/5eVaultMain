# Mind Scream
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 392*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*3rd-Order Telepathy Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You psionically pierce the mind of each enemy you can see within range. Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking `5d6` psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is automatically stabilized.

**Increased Order.** When you manifest this power, you can increase its order by 1 or more. For each increase of 1, the damage increases by `2d6`.
