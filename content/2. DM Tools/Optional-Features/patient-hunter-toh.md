*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 136*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Tome, "Hunter in Darkness" Patron

When you identify a creature's tracks using your tome, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Perception)) and Wisdom ([Survival](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks to find and track the creature for the next 24 hours.
