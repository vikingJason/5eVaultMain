# Break the Earth (14 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29*  

**Prerequisite**: 17th-level

As an action, you open a 10-foot-radius pit in the ground, floor, or other surface within 60 feet of you. The pit can be up to 50 feet deep, depending on the depth beneath the surface where it is opened. Each creature standing in the area when the pit opens must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature falls into the pit, taking `1d6` bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen and landing [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). On a success, the creature moves to an unoccupied space of their choice at the edge of the pit. A creature can climb the rough walls of the pit without an ability check.
