# Knowledge of the Wood
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 135*  

**Prerequisite**: 15th-level, "Old Wood" Patron

When you are within 5 feet of a body of water in a forest, you can cast [scrying](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying.md) on any creature in that forest at will, without expending a warlock spell slot or material components. You must remain within 5 feet of the body of water for the duration or the spell ends.
