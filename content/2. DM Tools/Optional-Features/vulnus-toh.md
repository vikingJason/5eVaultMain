# Vulnus
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 262*  

*The rune of fixation*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Piercing

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *vulnus* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't piercing, change the spell's damage type to piercing. This damage is still magical. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *vulnus*can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
