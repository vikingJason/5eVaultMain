# No Escape (1+ Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 28*  

**Prerequisite**: 2nd-level

At the start of your turn when your companion gains ferocity and doesn't enter a rampage, you can spend up to your Wisdom modifier in ferocity (minimum 1; no action required). Until the start of your next turn, your speed or your companion's speed (your choice) increases by 5 feet Ã— the ferocity spent.
