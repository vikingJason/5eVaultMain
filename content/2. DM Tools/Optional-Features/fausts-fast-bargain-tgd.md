# Faust's Fast Bargain
*Source: The Great Dale*  

When you roll an ability check, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check even if you aren't normally proficient. If you fail, you can't use this invocation again until you finish a short or long rest. If you succeed, you gain one level of exhaustion and can't use this ability again until you finish a long rest.

This level of exhaustion can't be fatal and this feature can't be used for ability checks regarding long-term attempts, such as for downtime activities.
