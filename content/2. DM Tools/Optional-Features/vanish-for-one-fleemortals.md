# Vanish for One
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 393*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*2nd-Order Resopathy Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You obscure yourself in the sight of a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or you become `invisible` to them for the duration (save ends at end of turn). This effect ends early if you attack the creature, deal damage to them, or create an effect that forces them to make a saving throw.

**Increased Order.** When you manifest this power, you can increase its order by 1 to make its manifestation time 1 bonus action.
