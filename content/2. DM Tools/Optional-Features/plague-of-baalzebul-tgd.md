# Plague of Baalzebul
*Source: The Great Dale*  

**Prerequisite**: [infestation](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/infestation-xge.md) cantrip

Targets of your [infestation](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/infestation-xge.md) cantrip take damage whether they succeed or fail on their saving throw against the spell. In addition, targets who fail their saving throw move in a direction you dictate instead of moving randomly. You cannot force a creature to move into an obvious hazard, such as into fire or off of a cliff. If you do not designate a direction, the target moves randomly as normal.
