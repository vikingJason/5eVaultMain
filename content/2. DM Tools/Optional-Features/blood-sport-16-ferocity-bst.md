# Blood Sport (16 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29*  

**Prerequisite**: 17th-level

When you hit a Large or smaller creature with a melee weapon attack, you can also push the target up to 30 feet away from you and knock them [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). If the target ends this move within 5 feet of your companion, the companion can make a signature attack against the target (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals its normal effects, and the target is pushed up to 30 feet away from your companion. If the target ends this move within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against them (no action required) that deals an extra `4d6` damage if it hits.
