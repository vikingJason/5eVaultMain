# Menacing Attack
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 74*  

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the end of your next turn.
