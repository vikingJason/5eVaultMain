# Dream Spores
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 391*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*5th-Order Telepathy Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You release a burst of psionic spores. Each creature you can see within 30 feet of you must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you for the duration. While charmed in this way, a creature must use their movement during their turn to move within 10 feet of you by the safest available route.

A creature charmed in this way can repeat the saving throw whenever they take damage, ending the effect on themself on a success.
