# Lux
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 259*  

*The rune of light*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Radiant

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *lux* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't radiant, change the spell's damage type to radiant. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *lux* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
