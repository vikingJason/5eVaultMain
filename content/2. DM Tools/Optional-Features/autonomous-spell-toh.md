# Autonomous Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 125*  

When you cast a spell that has a duration of concentration, you can spend 3 sorcery points to cast it without requiring concentration. For example, using autonomous spell on [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) changes its duration to 10 minutes. You can have only one autonomous spell in effect at a time. If you use this metamagic to modify a second spell, the first autonomous spell ends.
