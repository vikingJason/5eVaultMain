# Lightning Eruption (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 39*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the attack deals an extra `5d6` lightning damage and you can choose one other creature within 30 feet of the target that you can see. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you reach 17th level, both instances of damage increase to `6d6`.
