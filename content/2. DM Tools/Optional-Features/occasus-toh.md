# Occasus
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 259*  

*The rune of transition*

**Type**: Duration Rune

**Representation**: 1 hour to 8 hours

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *occasus* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a duration of 1 to 8 hours, increase the spell's duration by half. For example, a spell that lasts 1 hour lasts 1 and a half hours when you use this rune as a spellcasting focus. If the spell requires concentration, you must still maintain concentration.
