# Cloak of Flies
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 56*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level

As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you're [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) or you dismiss it as a bonus action.

The aura grants you advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage).

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
