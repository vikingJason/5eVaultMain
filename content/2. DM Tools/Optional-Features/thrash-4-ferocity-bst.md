# Thrash (4 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 28*  

**Prerequisite**: 2nd-level

When your companion hits a Large or smaller creature with a melee signature attack, you can use your reaction to command the companion to thrash the target from side to side, forcing them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, and attack rolls against the target have advantage, until the start of your next turn.
