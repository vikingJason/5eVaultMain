# Echo of the First Words
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 135*  

**Prerequisite**: 9th-level, "Primordial" Patron

The echo of the first magical utterance reverberates across time, confounding those who hear it. You can cast [babble](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/babble-toh.md) once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
