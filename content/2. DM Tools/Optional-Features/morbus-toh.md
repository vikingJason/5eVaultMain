# Morbus
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 259*  

*The rune of sickness*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Poison

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *morbus* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't poison, change the spell's damage type to poison. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *morbus* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
