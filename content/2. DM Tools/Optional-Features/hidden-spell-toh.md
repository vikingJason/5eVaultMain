# Hidden Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 125*  

When you cast a spell with a duration longer than instantaneous, you can spend 2 sorcery points to mask its magical aura. For the duration of your spell, it can't be detected or discerned with spells or effects, such as the [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md) spell or a chuul's Sense Magic trait.
