# Cerebrum
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 257*  

*The rune of thought*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Psychic

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *cerebrum* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't psychic, change the spell's damage type to psychic. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *cerebrum* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
