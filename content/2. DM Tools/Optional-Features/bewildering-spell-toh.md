# Bewildering Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 125*  

You can cast a spell that overwhelms the senses of its target. When you cast a spell that deals damage to one creature, you can spend 2 sorcery points to increase the intensity of the spell's visual effect. The target of your spell has disadvantage on the next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw it makes within the next minute.
