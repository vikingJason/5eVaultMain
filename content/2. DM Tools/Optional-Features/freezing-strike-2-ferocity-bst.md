# Freezing Strike (2 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 39*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level

You can activate this exploit whenever you take the Attack action. The first time you hit a creature with a weapon attack this turn, the attack deals an extra `1d6` cold damage and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The extra damage increases by `1d6` when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
