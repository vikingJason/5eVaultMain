# Ignis
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 258*  

*The rune of flame*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Fire

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *ignis* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't fire, change the spell's damage type to fire. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *ignis* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
