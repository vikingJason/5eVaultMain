# Cloud Rune
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 44*  

This rune emulates the deceptive magic used by some cloud giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) checks and Charisma ([Deception](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks.

In addition, when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and choose a different creature within 30 feet of you, other than the attacker. The chosen creature becomes the target of the attack, using the same roll. This magic can transfer the attack's effects regardless of the attack's range. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
