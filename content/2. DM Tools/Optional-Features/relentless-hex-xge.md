# Relentless Hex
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 57*  

**Prerequisite**: 7th-level; [hex](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hex.md) spell or a warlock feature that curses

Your curse creates a temporary bond between you and your target. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the target cursed by your [hex](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hex.md) spell or by a warlock feature of yours, such as Hexblade's Curse or Sign of Ill Omen. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the cursed target.
