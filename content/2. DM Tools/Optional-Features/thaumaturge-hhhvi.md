# Thaumaturge
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 115, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 51, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 78*  

**Prerequisite**: "Any" Patron, The ability to cast at least one spell, Proficiency in [Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion) or The ability to cast at least one spell, Is a follower of a deity, Proficiency in [Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion)

When a piece of armor needs the blessings of a god, or a sword needs a spirit coaxed into it, a thaumaturge is needed. These specialised crafters usually do not consider themselves crafters at all, but simply people with special connections to the gods and their divine energy. Thaumaturges are not limited to just those that worship the gods either, many fiendish cults can boast their own specialised thaumaturge members that craft their cursed daggers and bind damned souls into pieces of jewellery.

As strange as it is to say, the gods do not see everyone as equals, and certainly do not apportion their gifts impartially. A vagrant holy man is probably capable of invoking his god's name to create a few vials of holy water, while a high cleric of Moradin would be able to bless a hammer so that it strikes with the same fury as their furious deity.

Any character that is proficient in the [Religion](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Religion) skill, has access to at least one spell slot, and is a follower of a deity or otherworldly patron, may be considered a thaumaturge for crafting purposes.
