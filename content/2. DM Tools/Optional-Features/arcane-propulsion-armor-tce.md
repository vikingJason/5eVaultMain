# Arcane Propulsion Armor
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 20*  

**Prerequisite**: 14th-level

The wearer of this armor gains these benefits:

- The wearer's walking speed increases by 5 feet.  
- The armor includes gauntlets, each of which is a magic melee weapon that can be wielded only when the hand is holding nothing. The wearer is proficient with the gauntlets, and each one deals `1d8` force damage on a hit and has the thrown property, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When thrown, the gauntlet detaches and flies at the attack's target, then immediately returns to the wearer and reattaches.  
- The armor can't be removed against the wearer's will.  
- If the wearer is missing any limbs, the armor replaces those limbsâ€”hands, arms, feet, legs, or similar appendages. The replacements function identically to the body parts they replace.
