# Grasping Arrow
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 29*  

When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra `2d6` poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes `2d6` slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to `4d6` when you reach 18th level in this class.
