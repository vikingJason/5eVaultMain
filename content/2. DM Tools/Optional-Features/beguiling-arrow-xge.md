# Beguiling Arrow
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 29*  

Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra `2d6` psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.

The psychic damage increases to `4d6` when you reach 18th level in this class.
