# Deserved Transfer
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 391*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*2nd-Order Metamorphosis Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You fire a bolt of draining psychic energy at a creature within range. Make a ranged power attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `2d8` psychic damage, and the psychic energy bounces to another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The second creature gains temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

**Increased Order.** When you manifest this power, you can increase its order by 1 or more. For each increase of 1, the damage increases by `2d8`.
