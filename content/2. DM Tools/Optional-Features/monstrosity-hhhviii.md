# Monstrosity
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 113*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level Monk (Observed Form)

Your versatile stance allows you to be prepared for any situation. While in this stance, whenever you make a saving throw, you may use your reaction to add your Wisdom modifier as a bonus to the result. You may choose to do this after making the roll but before the DM says whether you succeeded or failed.
