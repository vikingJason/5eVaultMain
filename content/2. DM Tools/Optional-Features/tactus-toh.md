# Tactus
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 261*  

*The rune of transference*

**Type**: Range Rune

**Representation**: Touch

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *tactus* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a range of touch, the spell has a chance to affect multiple targets. Roll a `d100`. On a roll of 51 or higher, the spell affects one additional creature within 5 feet of your target (excluding yourself). If there are multiple creatures within 5 feet of the target, you choose which additional creature is affected.
