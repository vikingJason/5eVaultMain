# Acidum
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 257*  

*The rune of undoing*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Acid

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *acidum* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't acid, change the spell's damage type to acid. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *acidum* can't be used this way again until you finish a short or long rest.
