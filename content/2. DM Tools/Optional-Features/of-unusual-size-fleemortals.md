# Of Unusual Size
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 326*  

**Prerequisite**: Sewer-Dwelling Creature

If the sewer creature is Small or Tiny, their size increases to Medium and their Hit Dice type changes to a d8. This gives them 1 extra hit point per Hit Die if originally Small, or 2 extra hit points per Hit Die if originally Tiny.
