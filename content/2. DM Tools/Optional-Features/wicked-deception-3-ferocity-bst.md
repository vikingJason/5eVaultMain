# Wicked Deception (3 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 36*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level

As an action, choose a creature hostile to you that you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suddenly view you and your companion as friends until the end of your next turn. While in this state, the creature is unable to attack or otherwise harm you or your companion. This effect ends early if you or your companion attacks the affected creature. Creatures immune to the [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition can't be affected by this exploit.
