# Fiend
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 113*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level Monk (Observed Form)

Your vicious stance allows you to capitalise on your opponent's mistakes and punish them accordingly. Whenever you hit a creature with an [opportunity attack](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#opportunity%20attack) while in this stance, you may immediately use your [Flurry of Blows](2-Mechanics/CLI/classes/monk.md#Flurry%20of%20Blows%20(Level%202)) feature as a free action. You still need to spend 1 ki point to use it in this way.
