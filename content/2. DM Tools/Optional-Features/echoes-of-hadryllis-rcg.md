# Echoes of Hadryllis
*Source: Rashemen - Unnapproachable East Campaign Guide*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level, Pact of the Blade

If you summon a greatsword with your pact of the blade feature, it deals an additional `1d8` radiant damage to fey and fiends. While wielding the greatsword, you are constantly under the effect of [detect magic](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic.md), and if you're forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to unsummon your pact of the blade to add `1d8` to your saving throw.
