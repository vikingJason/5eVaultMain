**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level Monk (Observed Form)

Your natural stance allows you to fight freely and utilise your energy efficiently. While in this stance, whenever you spend 1 or more ki points to use an ability, you may roll a `d20`. If you roll an 18, 19, or 20 on this roll, you instantly regain the ki points you just spent.
