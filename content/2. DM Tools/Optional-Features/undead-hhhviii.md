*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 113*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level Monk (Observed Form)

Your rigid stance allows you to suffer large damage and continue fighting. Whenever you take damage, you may use your reaction to expend 1 ki point to reduce the total damage taken by an amount equal to your monk level.
