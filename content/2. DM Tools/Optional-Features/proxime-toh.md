# Proxime
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 260*  

*The rune of proximity*

**Type**: Range Rune

**Representation**: 5 feet to 30 feet

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *proxime* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a range of 5 to 30 feet, you don't need to see your target to cast the spell, even if the spell normally requires you to see the target. You must still be aware of the target's presence or existence within range.
