# Thunderous Rebuke (6 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 41*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

When you or your companion is hit with a melee attack by a creature within 5 feet of that target, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the attacker takes `3d6` thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the target. On a success, the attacker takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `4d6`.
