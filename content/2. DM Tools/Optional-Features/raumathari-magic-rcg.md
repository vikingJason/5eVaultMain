# Raumathari Magic
*Source: Rashemen - Unnapproachable East Campaign Guide*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Hexblade" Patron

Your spells cast on a cursed target can be made harder to resist. If a creature under your Hexblade's curse succeeds on a saving throw against one of your spells, you can use your reaction to force them to make the save again. The creature must use the new result.
