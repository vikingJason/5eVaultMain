*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 326*  

**Prerequisite**: Sewer-Dwelling Creature

The sewer creature gains resistance to poison damage and immunity to the [poisoned](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition. If the creature already has resistance to poison damage, they gain immunity to poison damage instead.
