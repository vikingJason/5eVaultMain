# Flay
*Source: Strongholds and Followers p. 195*  

- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
- **Duration:** 1 round  
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)  
- **Charges:** 2 per d6 of damage  

As a bonus action, the dragon blasts pure psionic energy from its eyes, frying the brains of all creatures in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it takes psychic damage of a d6 per 2 charges spent, or half as much damage on a successful one.
