# Fearful Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 125*  

When you cast a spell that deals damage to a creature, you can spend 3 sorcery points to make the target of your spell [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the end of your next turn. If your spell affects multiple targets, you can choose only one of the targets to be [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened).
