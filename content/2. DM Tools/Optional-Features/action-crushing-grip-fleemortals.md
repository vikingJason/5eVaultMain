# Action: Crushing Grip
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 38*  

**Prerequisite**: Eagle or falcon

The bird's powerful talons crush a creature they are grappling or attached to. The target must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw, taking 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
