# Wings When I Need Them (5 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 39*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level

At the start of your turn when your companion gains ferocity and doesn't enter a rampage, you can manifest a spectral eagle (no action required) that lifts you or your companion (your choice) to the sky. The target gains a flying speed equal to their walking speed until the start of their next turn.
