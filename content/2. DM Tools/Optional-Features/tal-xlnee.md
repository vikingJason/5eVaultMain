# Tal

***Reckoning***

Once you gain the Sentinel's Reckoning feature at 10th level, you can activate a rune with the Tal command word as an action. This rune manifests in the air around you when activated.

## Ild

Each creature within a 5-foot-radius of you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage equal to `2d6` × the number of runes you have active on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Kalt

An eruption of magical frost blasts from you in a radius equal to 10 feet × the number of runes you have active. All creatures of your choice within the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained for a number of rounds equal to the number of active runes. At the end of each of their turns, they can repeat the saving throw to break free.

## Ond

Life spirits swirl about you in a 5-foot-radius. All creatures of your choice within that radius regain hit points equal to `1d6` × the number of runes you have active.

## Stein

You release your runic power in an arc before you, creating a cone of difficult terrain as jagged earth erupts equal to 5 feet × the number of runes you have active. When a creature enters this area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes `2d4` slashing damage.

## Vind

A furious cyclone whips up a strong wind around you. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take `1d10` bludgeoning damage, be pushed a number of feet equal to 5 × the number of runes you have active (minimum of 5 feet), and fall prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
