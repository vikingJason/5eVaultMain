# Ethereal Jaunt
*Source: Tome of Beasts*  

As a bonus action, the creature can magically shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.

> [!note]
> This is referenced as a spell in various statblocks in Tome of Beasts. While the text is only presented in full on one statblock, we assume the feature works the same for other creatures (in addition, this matches the feature with the same name found in official Wizards of the Coast sourcebooks).
