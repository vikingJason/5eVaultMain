# Tempestas
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 261*  

*The rune of storms*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Lightning

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *tempestas* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't lightning, change the spell's damage type to lightning. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *tempestas* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
