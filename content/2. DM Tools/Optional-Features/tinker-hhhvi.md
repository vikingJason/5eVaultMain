# Tinker
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 115, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 51, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 78*  

**Prerequisite**: Proficiency with [Tinker's Tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinkers-tools.md)

Tinkers are a rare profession, but their work possesses incredible value. Tinkers are usually associated with finnicky contraptions and devices, and if they ever use magic it is usually more of an energy source rather than the driving characteristic. Really, tinkers are more concerned with finding new materials with strange properties to experiment with, and their inventions can range from the entertaining to the absolutely revolutionary.

With that in mind, tinkers vary widely in skill. A travelling peddler may have some experience in making mechanical puppets that flail around for the amusement of children, while the daring few that have travelled to Mechanus and returned alive may have unlocked the secrets of artificial life.

Any character that is proficient in the [tinker's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/tinkers-tools.md) may be considered a tinker for crafting purposes.
