# Sympathy
*Source: Strongholds and Followers p. 196*  

- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction  
- **Duration:** Instantaneous  
- **Range:** 30 feet  
- **Charges:** 2 charges per d8  

The dragon violently reacts to being hurt, raking its enemy's nervous system with sympathetic psionic vibrations.

As a reaction to taking damage from something the dragon can see within 30 feet, the dragon expends charges to force the damaging creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d8 psychic damage per 2 charges spent. The maximum damage this can deal equals the damage dealt to the dragon that prompted this manifestation.
