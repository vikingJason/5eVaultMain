# Impulsum
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 258*  

*The rune of impact*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Bludgeoning

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *impulsum* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't bludgeoning, change the spell's damage type to bludgeoning. This damage is still magical. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *impulsum* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
