# Wrathful Parry
*Source: The Great Dale*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Blade

When a hostile creature that you can see within 5 feet of you would hit you with a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to increase your AC against the attack by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier. If the attack misses as a result, the target takes psychic damage equal to your warlock level; if it still hits, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to half your warlock level.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
