# Imbue Projectile (14 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29*  

**Prerequisite**: 17th-level

As an action, you make a ranged weapon attack. Whether or not the attack hits, a wave of energy explodes from the weapon or ammunition used in the attack, centered on your target. Each creature within 20 feet of the target (including the target and excluding your companion) must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `10d6` force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
