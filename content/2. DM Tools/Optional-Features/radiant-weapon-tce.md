# Radiant Weapon
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 22, Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 62*  

**Prerequisite**: 6th-level

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, the wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action.

The weapon has 4 charges. As a reaction immediately after being hit by an attack, the wielder can expend 1 charge and cause the attacker to be [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of the attacker's next turn, unless the attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The weapon regains `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn.
