# Aspect of Hadryllis
*Source: Rashemen - Unnapproachable East Campaign Guide*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level, Pact of the Blade

If you summon a greatsword with your pact of the blade feature, it deals an additional `1d8` psychic damage to fey and fiends. While wielding your summoned greatsword, you also can use your action to cast [enhance ability](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/enhance-ability.md) at will, but you can only use the Bull's Strength option.
