# Bury the Dead (16 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29*  

**Prerequisite**: 17th-level

When you and your companion are within 5 feet of a creature, you can use an action to cause a vicious whirlwind filled with debris and dirt to rise around the creature, which must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes `8d6` bludgeoning damage, is knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone), and is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). On a success, the target takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) or [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A creature [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) this way can use an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your exploit save DC, freeing themself on a success.
