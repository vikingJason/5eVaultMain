# Elemental Shield (3 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 39*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use a reaction to give the affected creature resistance to that damage type (including against the triggering attack) until the end of their next turn.
