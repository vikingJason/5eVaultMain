# Infernal Flames (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 38*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

As an action, you cause a blast of fire to erupt from your companion. Each creature within 20 feet of the companion must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `4d10` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You and your companion take no damage from this effect.

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
