# Meat Hook
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 112*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level Fighter (Butcher)

If you dealt piercing damage, you may make a [grapple](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#grapple) check against your target by lodging your weapon in your target's body as part of the same attack. While you have a creature [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) this way, you cannot make attacks with the weapon you used to [grapple](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#grapple) them. Whenever a creature [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way attempts to escape the [grapple](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#grapple) and fails, they automatically suffer `1d8` piercing damage as they clumsily attempt to remove the weapon piercing them.
