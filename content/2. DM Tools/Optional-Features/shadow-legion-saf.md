## Traits

### Amorphous

The legion can move into another unit, occupying its space and engaging that unit. As such, the legion can attack archers while enemy infantry is still on the field.

### Strength Drain

If the legion inflicts a casualty on an engaged unit, that unit loses 1 Power. Lost Power regenerates the next day.

### Horrify

If the legion inflicts a casualty on a mortal unit, that unit must make a DC 15 Morale check. Failure exhausts the unit.
