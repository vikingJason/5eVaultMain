The gemstone dragons know that the weave of the timescape isn't a true forceâ€”it's little more than a quirk of geometry. One they can enhance or reverse at their discretion.

Choose a target within range and select either *Levitas* or *Gravitas*. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer the effect described below.

**Levitas.** The target rises 10 feet per round. A levitating target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, until they save. When the target eventually hits the ground, it takes `1d6` damage per 10 feet fallen, with the maximum dice equal to their level (e.g., `5d6` for level 5).

**Gravitas.** The target's movement is reduced to 10 feet.
