# Shadow Arrow
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 136*  

**Prerequisite**: 12th-level, Pact of the Blade, "Hunter in Darkness" Patron

When you hit a creature with an arrow shot from your pact weapon, you can fire a second, shadow arrow at the creature as a bonus action. If it hits, the shadow arrow deals necrotic damage equal to the damage dealt by the first arrow.
