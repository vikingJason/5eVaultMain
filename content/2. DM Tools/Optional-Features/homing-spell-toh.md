# Homing Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 125*  

When you cast a spell that deals damage to one creature, you can spend 2 sorcery points to target a creature that has total cover or is heavily obscured, provided you are aware of the target's presence. This metamagic option allows you to target the creature, but it doesn't cause the spell to automatically affect the target. As normal, the target must still make a saving throw or be hit by your spell attack to be affected by the spell.
