# Water Whip
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 81*  

You can spend 2 ki points as an action to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `3d10` bludgeoning damage, plus an extra `1d10` bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can either knock it [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
