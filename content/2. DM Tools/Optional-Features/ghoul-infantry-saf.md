## Traits

### Undead

Levies as well as Green and Regular troops must succeed on a Morale check in order to attack this unit. Each enemy unit need only do this once.

### Horrify

Inflicting a casualty on a mortal unit forces a DC 15 Morale check. Failure exhausts the unit.

### Feast

If this unit diminishes an enemy unit, it immediately gains a free attack against that unit.
