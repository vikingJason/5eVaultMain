# Ancestral Magic
*Source: Rashemen - Unnapproachable East Campaign Guide*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Talisman

Your ancestors can empower your spells, making them more difficult to resist. When you cast a spell, you can expend a use of your talisman. If you do, choose one creature affected by the spell and subtract `1d4` from their saving throw for that spell.
