# Mind Splinter
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 392*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*1st-Order Telepathy Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to erase your image from the mind of a creature within range. Make a ranged power attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `1d6` psychic damage, and you become [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) to them until the start of your next turn.

This power's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (`2d6`), 11th level (`3d6`), and 17th level (`4d6`).
