# Unarmed Fighting
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42*  

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to `1d6` + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a [shield](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md) when you make the attack roll, the `d6` becomes a `d8`.

At the start of each of your turns, you can deal `1d4` bludgeoning damage to one creature [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by you.
