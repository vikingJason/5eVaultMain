# Lava Geyser (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 39*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

As an action, you summon a powerful rush of lava centered on a point on the ground you can see within 30 feet of you. The lava fills a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 5-foot radius, and forces each creature in its area to make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `4d6` fire damage and is knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). The lava then dissolves into fiery mist and fades away.

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
