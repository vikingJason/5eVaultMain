# Reflection
*Source: Strongholds and Followers p. 196*  

- **Casting Time:** 1 action  
- **Duration:** 1 minute  
- **Range:** Self  
- **Charges:** 10 + reflection rank  

The dragon reaches through time and plucks an ally from the timescape to come and fight alongside it. Choose a row from the [Servitors](2-Mechanics/CLI/tables/servitors-saf.md) chart. The cost of manifesting a reflection is 10 charges plus the type of the summoned creature on the table. (For example, summoning the [Inexorable of Nature](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/nature-saf.md) costs 16 charges: 10 plus the Inexorable's type of 6.)
