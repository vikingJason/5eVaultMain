# Convulsions of the World
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 135*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level

Your mind reaches deep into the ground and an elder voice answers. You can use an action to cause a localized tremor to shake the ground around you. Each creature other than yourself within 20 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). You can choose a number of creatures equal to half your proficiency bonus to automatically succeed on this saving throw. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation again.
