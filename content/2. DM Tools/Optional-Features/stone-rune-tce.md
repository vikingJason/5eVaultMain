# Stone Rune
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 45*  

This rune's magic channels the judiciousness associated with stone giants. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks, and you have [darkvision](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you for 1 minute. While [charmed](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), descending into a dreamy stupor. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once you invoke this rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
