# Tree Stride
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 299*  

**Prerequisite**: Enchanted-Forest-Dwelling Creature

Once per turn, the enchanted forest creature can use 10 feet of their movement to step magically into one living tree within reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be the same size category as the enchanted forest creature or bigger.
