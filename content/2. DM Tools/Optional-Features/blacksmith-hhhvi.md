# Blacksmith
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume I p. 114, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume II p. 50, Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 77*  

**Prerequisite**: Proficiency with [Smith's Tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/smiths-tools.md)

A hammer striking anvil, the roar of a heated forge, and the hiss of cooling metal. These are the sounds of a blacksmith's shop, the masters and crafters of metal. While the job of a blacksmith is usually simplified to a "metalworker", the role encompasses so much more. Blacksmiths craft and fix all manners of equipment ranging from farming equipment, to weapons, to suits of armor. Not only that, but while blacksmiths normally deal strictly with metal, many creature shells, bones, and scales require metal reinforcement and/or attachments before they can be used as weapons and armor. As such, even though they are organic materials, it is still primarily a blacksmith's responsibility to craft with them.

Blacksmith skills can vary wildly. The local blacksmith may only have a small forge from where they repair the hammers and scythes of their neighbours, while the master smiths of dwarven kingdoms smelt adamantine in rivers of magma at the heart of volcanoes.

Any character that is proficient in the [smith's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/smiths-tools.md) may be considered a blacksmith for crafting purposes.
