+++# Aberration
*Source: Hamund's Harvesting Handbook: Volume III p. 113*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level Monk (Observed Form)

Your erratic stance makes it difficult for your opponent to read your movements, preventing them from getting an edge on you in battle. While in this stance, if a creature attempts to make an attack roll with advantage against you, you can use your reaction to cancel that advantage and any other advantages they may have on attack rolls against you for the rest of the turn.
