# Mensis
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 259*  

*The rune of seasons*

**Type**: Duration Rune

**Representation**: 2 Days â€“ 30 Days

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *mensis* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a duration of 2 to 30 days, increase the spell's duration by half. For example, a spell that lasts 2 days lasts 3 days when you use this rune as a spellcasting focus. If the spell requires concentration, you must still maintain concentration.
