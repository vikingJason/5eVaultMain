# Aerial Pursuit (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 38*  

**Prerequisite**: Merlin (bird of prey)

When the bird starts their turn in the air, they can triple their flying speed until the end of their turn. If they descend at least 30 feet on that turn, they have advantage on the next attack they make before the end of their turn. (Replaces the High-Speed Dive trait.)
