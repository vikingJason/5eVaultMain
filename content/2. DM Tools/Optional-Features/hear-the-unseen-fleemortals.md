# Hear the Unseen
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 292*  

**Prerequisite**: Cave-Dwelling Creature

At the start of their turn, the cave creature can emit a subsonic trill (no action required). If they aren't [deafened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened), they can see their surroundings, including [invisible](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and hidden creatures within 200 feet of them who aren't behind total cover, until the end of their turn.
