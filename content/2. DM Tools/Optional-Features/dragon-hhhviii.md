**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level Monk (Observed Form)

Your ancient stance grants you mystical abilities drawn from the most powerful creatures in the multiverse. When you adopt this stance, you choose to gain either a flying or swimming speed equal to half your current speed. On subsequent turns, you may use your bonus action to change your choice to the other movement type.
