# Insatiable Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 126*  

When you cast a spell on a creature that is immune to the damage or effects of the spell, you can spend 5 sorcery points to bypass the creature's immunity for this casting of the spell. The creature is affected by the spell as if it didn't have immunity to the spell's damage or effects and must make any saving throws allowed by the spell as normal.
