# Silver Magic
*Source: Rashemen - Unnapproachable East Campaign Guide*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Chain

With effort, your enchantment and illusion spells can be made harder to resist. If a creature succeeds on a saving throw against one of your enchantment or illusion spells, you can use your reaction to force them to make the save again. The creature must use the new result.
