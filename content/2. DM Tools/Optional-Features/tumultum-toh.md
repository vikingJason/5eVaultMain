# Tumultum
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 262*  

*The rune of sound*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Thunder

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *tumultum* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't thunder, change the spell's damage type to thunder. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *tumultum* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
