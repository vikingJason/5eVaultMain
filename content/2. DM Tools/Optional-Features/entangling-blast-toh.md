# Entangling Blast
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 135*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level, "Primordial" Patron, [eldritch blast](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eldritch-blast.md)

When you hit a creature with [eldritch blast](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eldritch-blast.md), the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by roots, vines, and other vegetation until the end of its next turn. The DC for this saving throw and to escape this [grapple](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#grapple) is your spell save DC.
