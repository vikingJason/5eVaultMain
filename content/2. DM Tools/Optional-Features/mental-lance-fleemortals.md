# Mental Lance
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 392*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*3rd-Order Telepathy Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You mentally assail a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `4d10` psychic damage and is [frightened](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you for the duration (save ends at end of turn). On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.

**Increased Order.** When you manifest this power, you can increase its order by 1 or more. For each increase of 1, the damage increases by `2d10`.
