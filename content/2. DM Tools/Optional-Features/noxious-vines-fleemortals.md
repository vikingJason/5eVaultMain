*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 137*  

**Prerequisite**: Green Hag in a Coven

(Recharge 5-6) Long toxic vines whip out from the hag. Each enemy within 30 feet of the hag must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each ally within 30 feet of the hag regains 18 (`4d8`) hit points.
