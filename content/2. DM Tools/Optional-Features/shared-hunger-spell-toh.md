# Shared Hunger Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 126*  

When you cast a beneficial spell on a friendly creature, you can spend 3 sorcery points to empower the creature's weapons. The creature's next weapon attack roll has advantage and, if the creature hits, you and the creature regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
