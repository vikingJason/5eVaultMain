# Phase
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 392*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*4th-Order Metamorphosis Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You imbue your body and everything you wear and carry with psychic energy, allowing it to pass through solid objects. For the duration, you can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take `1d10` force damage if you end your turn inside an object. If this power ends while you are inside a creature or object, you are shunted out of it into the closest unoccupied space of your choice.

**Increased Order.** When you manifest this power, you can increase its order by 1 or more. For each increase of 1, you target one additional creature within 5 feet of you.
