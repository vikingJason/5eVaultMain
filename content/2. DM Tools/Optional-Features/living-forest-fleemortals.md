# Living Forest
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 299*  

**Prerequisite**: Enchanted-Forest-Dwelling Creature

A writhing grove thrives in a 30-foot radius centered on the enchanted forest creature. Mist lightly obscures that area, and colorful vines and shifting foliage make its ground difficult terrain. Teasing voices laugh and whisper, giving other creatures in that area disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells and similar effects. Flickering lights extinguish magical darkness in that area created by spells of 3rd level or lower. (When adding this trait to a creature, you can choose to exclude one or more of these effects.)
