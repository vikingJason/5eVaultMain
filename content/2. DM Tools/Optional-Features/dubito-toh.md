# Dubito
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 257*  

*The rune of hesitation*

**Type**: Duration Rune

**Representation**: Less than 1 minute

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *dubito* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a duration less than 1 minute, double the spell's duration. For example, a spell that lasts 1 round lasts 2 rounds when you use this rune as a spellcasting focus. If the spell requires concentration, you must still maintain concentration.
