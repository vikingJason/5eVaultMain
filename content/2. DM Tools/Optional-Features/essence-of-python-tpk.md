# Essence of Python
*Source: Total Party Kill Bestiary - Vol. 1 p. 17*  

## Benefits

### Endurance of the Jungle

The hybrid has a +4 bonus to Strength and Constitution.

### Increased Fortitude

The hybrid has five additional Hit Dice, and its hit point maximum is increased by 32 plus its Constitution modifier, multiplied by 5.

### Python Biology

The hybrid has a climb speed equal to its speed, it has [blindsight](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#blindsight) up to 20 feet, and it has the Constrict and Swallow Whole actions.

## Actions

### Constrict

*Melee Weapon Attack:* +(Strength modifier + proficiency bonus) to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:*  (4d12 + Strength modifier) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC [8 + Strength modifier + proficiency bonus]). Until this grapple ends the target is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), the target can't breathe, and the hybrid can't constrict another target.

### Swallow Whole

*Melee Weapon Attack:* +(Strength modifier + proficiency bonus) to hit, reach 15 ft., one Large or smaller [incapacitated](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) creature. *Hit:*  The hybrid swallows the target. A swallowed creature is [blinded](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside of the hybrid, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the hybrid's turns.

If the hybrid takes 30 damage or more in a single turn from a creature inside it, the hybrid must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures which fall [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the hybrid. If the hybrid dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
