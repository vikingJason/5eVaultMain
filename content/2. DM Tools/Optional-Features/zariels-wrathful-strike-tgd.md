When a creature within 30 feet of you damages you with an attack, you can cast [true strike](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-strike.md) against it as a reaction. If the attack empowered by [true strike](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/true-strike.md) hits the target, the target takes additional psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
