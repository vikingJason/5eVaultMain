# Piscine Transformation
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 393*  

**Prerequisite**: Talent Class

*3rd-Order Metamorphosis Power*

**Manifestation Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You target a Humanoid you can see within range with a pulse of transformational energy. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or undergo one of the following transformations of your choice for the duration. The target can choose to fail this saving throw.

- **Head.** The target's head transforms into the head of a fish, proportionately sized for their body. They can't speak.  
- **Legs.** The target's legs become fins. Their walking speed is reduced to 10 feet (unless their walking speed is slower), and they gain a swimming speed of 30 feet.  
- **Torso.** The target's torso becomes the body of a fish with gills. They can only breathe water and can hold their breath for 1 hour. If the target isn't underwater when this transformation takes effect, they begin suffocating.  

**Increased Order.** When you manifest this power, you can increase its order by 2 to target any creature, instead of just a Humanoid, if they have the necessary body part you wish to transform.

Additionally, you can increase this power's order by 2 to increase its duration to 1 hour.
