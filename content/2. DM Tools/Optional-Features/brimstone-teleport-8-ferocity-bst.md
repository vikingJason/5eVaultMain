# Brimstone Teleport (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 38*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

As an action, you teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each creature within 5 feet of the space you leave and each creature within 5 feet of your destination space must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `4d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You and your companion take no damage from this effect.

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
