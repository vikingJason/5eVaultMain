# Hellish Wound (4 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 36*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level

When your companion hits another creature other than a construct or an undead with their attack, you can have the attack deal a hellish wound to the creature (no action required). At the start of each of their turns, a target with a hellish wound loses `1d10` hit points for each hellish wound they have. All of a target's hellish wounds close if they receive magical healing, or if any creature uses an action to staunch the wounds with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check with a DC equal to your exploit save DC.
