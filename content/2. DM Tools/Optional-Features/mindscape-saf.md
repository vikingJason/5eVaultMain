The dragon implants a vision of a new landscape in the target's mind, making them blind to their actual surroundings, causing them to move randomly and erratically. Choose a target to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, this manifestation becomes active. If the target chooses to move while the manifestation is active, it moves 10 feet in a random direction (roll `1d8`) instead of the distance and direction it intended.
