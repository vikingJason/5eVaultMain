This manor could be granted to the characters by a local pirate captain as a peace offering or equitable division of pirating waters or by a local magistrate after authorities caught and imprisoned the island's former lord. It includes a single tower high up the side of volcanic slopes, plus numerous tree houses secluded in the jungle canopy, and it sustains itself from fishing, fresh fruits and nuts, and produces income from obsidian and pearl-diving.
