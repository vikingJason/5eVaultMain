*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 135*  

**Prerequisite**: "Primordial" Patron, [eldritch blast](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eldritch-blast.md)

When you hit a creature with [eldritch blast](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/eldritch-blast.md), you reduce the light surrounding it until the end of your next turn. If the creature is in bright light, the area within 10 feet of it becomes dim light. If the creature is in dim light, the area within 10 feet of it becomes darkness.
