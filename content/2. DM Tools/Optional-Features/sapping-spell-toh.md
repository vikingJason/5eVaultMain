# Sapping Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 126*  

You can increase the damage you deal with a spell by expending 2 sorcery points and up to half your remaining Hit Dice. Roll the Hit Dice and add the total result to the damage dealt by the spell. You then take damage equal to half the amount of damage your Hit Dice added to the spell's damage.
