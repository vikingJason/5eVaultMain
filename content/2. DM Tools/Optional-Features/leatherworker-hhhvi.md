**Prerequisite**: Proficiency with [Leatherworker's Tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/leatherworkers-tools.md)

Metal armor doesn't agree with everyone, and many creatures have perfectly good hides that they won't be using anymore. For times like these, a leatherworker is required. It is a long and messy job to take raw hides, tan them, preserve them, cut them, and fashion them into armor and other equipment, but most societies would break down without this crucial industry.

While leatherworkers are often looked down upon for their unpleasant job, these are usually just the leatherworkers that deal with mundane animal hides and skins. Highly skilled leatherworkers however are treated with the utmost respect since without them, your skinned [Purple Worm](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) hides would go completely to waste.

Any character that is proficient in the [leatherworker's tools](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/leatherworkers-tools.md) may be considered a leatherworker for crafting purposes.
