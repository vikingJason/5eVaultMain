Target one creature. The dragon infects the mind of the target with a new belief. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or suffer an effect chosen from the list below.

## Friends:

Until the end of its next turn, the target will not attack enemy combatants, and enemies have advantage on their next attack against this target.

## Enemies:

On its next action, the target will move to the closest ally and attack it.

## Chasm

The target perceives a chasm opening up beneath it. It falls [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) and takes `1d8` psychic damage. This belief persistsâ€”at the start of each round, the target makes an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, it continues feeling as though it is falling into an infinite abyss, taking `1d8` psychic damage.

## Wonder:

The target does nothing during its next turn.

## Disaster:

The target feels the world is ending and flees during its next turn.
