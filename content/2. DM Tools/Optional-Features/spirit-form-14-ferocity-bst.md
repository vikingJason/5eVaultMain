# Spirit Form (14 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 30*  

**Prerequisite**: 17th-level

As a bonus action, you make you and your companion incorporeal until the end of your next turn. While incorporeal, you each have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage, and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. While incorporeal, you and your companion each gain a flying speed equal to your individual walking speed, and each of you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Either of you takes `1d10` force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
