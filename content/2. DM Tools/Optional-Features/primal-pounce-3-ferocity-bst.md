# Primal Pounce (3 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 28*  

**Prerequisite**: 2nd-level

When your companion hits a creature with their signature attack, you can use your reaction to command the companion to grapple the target. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the companion grabs the target and the target is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC equal to your exploit save DC). The grapple also ends if your companion attacks a creature other than the target.
