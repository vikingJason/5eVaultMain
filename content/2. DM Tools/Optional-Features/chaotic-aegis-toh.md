# Chaotic Aegis
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 134*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level, "Wyrdweaver" Patron

The pact with your patron offers protection from the powers of entropy. When you or a creature targeting you with an effect must roll a die or dice and consult a table to determine the outcome of the effect, such as with the [confusion](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/confusion.md) spell, you can use your reaction to force a reroll of the die or dice. You must use the new result. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this invocation again.
