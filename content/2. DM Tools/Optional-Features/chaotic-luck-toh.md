# Chaotic Luck
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 135*  

**Prerequisite**: 3rd-level, "Wyrdweaver" Patron

The tumbling dice of fate sometimes fall in your favor. When you are hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the damage dice. You must accept the new damage roll. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this invocation again.
