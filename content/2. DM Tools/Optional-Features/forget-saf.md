# Forget
*Source: Strongholds and Followers p. 195*  

- **Casting Time:** 1 action  
- **Duration:** Special  
- **Range:** 60 feet  
- **Charges:** 5 + 1 per spell level if a spell is chosen  

The dragon reaches into an enemy's mind and plucks a critical memory from their cortex, either the knowledge of a spell or of a weapon. This effect lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The dragon can only use this manifestation once every ten minutes on the same target. Saving against the manifestation means the target is immune to *forget* for 24 hours.

## Spells:

Pick a target and choose a spell the target knows. Spend charges equal in number to 5 plus the spell level. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast that spell until the effect of this manifestation ends.

## Weapons:

Pick a target and choose a weapon. Spend 3 extra charges. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target does not gain the benefit of their proficiency bonus with the chosen kind of weapon while the effect lasts. (For example, they might forget how to use a [longsword](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/longsword.md), but still gain their proficiency benefit with [shortswords](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword.md).)
