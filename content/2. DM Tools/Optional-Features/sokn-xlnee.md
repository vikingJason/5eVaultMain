# Sokn
*Source: Xanathar's Lost Notes to Everything Else p. 20*  

***Attack Augmentation***

You can activate a rune with the Sokn augmentation as a bonus action. A rune's power only affects the weapon it is inscribed on.

## Ild

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you ignite the target. While this rune is active, each creature you've burned takes `1d4` fire damage at the start of its turn for each time you've burned it, and it can then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such burns on itself on a success. Alternatively, the burned creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your runic save DC, ending the effect of all burns on it on a success.

## Kalt

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

## Ond

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional `1d4` necrotic damage and you recover hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

## Stein

When you hit a Large or smaller creature with a weapon attack, it must make a Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failed save.

## Vind

When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
