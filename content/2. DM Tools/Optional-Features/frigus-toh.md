# Frigus
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 258*  

*The rune of frost*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Cold

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *frigus* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't cold, change the spell's damage type to cold. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *frigus* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
