# Rend (12 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29*  

**Prerequisite**: 17th-level

As an action, choose a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and your companion. You make a melee weapon attack against the target, and your companion makes a signature attack against the target (no actions required) If you both hit and deal damage to the target, the target is knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) and takes an additional `6d6` damage of a type dealt by either attack (your choice).
