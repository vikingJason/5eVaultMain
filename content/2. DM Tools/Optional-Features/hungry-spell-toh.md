# Hungry Spell
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 126*  

When you cast a spell that deals damage to a single target, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add your Charisma modifier to the damage roll of the spell. If you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a hungry spell, you regain hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
