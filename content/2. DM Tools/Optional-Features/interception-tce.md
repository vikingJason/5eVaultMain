# Interception
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 41*  

When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by `1d10` + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a [shield](2-Mechanics/CLI/items/shield.md) or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.
