# Scopum
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 261*  

*The rune of precision*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Slashing

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *scopum* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't slashing, change the spell's damage type to slashing. This damage is still magical. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *scopum* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
