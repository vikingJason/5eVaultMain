# Terra
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 262*  

*The rune of land*

**Type**: Range Rune

**Representation**: 1 mile or farther

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *terra* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a range of 1 mile or more, increase the spell's range by half. For example, if you cast a spell that normally has a range of 1 mile, it has a range of 1 and a half miles when you use this rune as a spellcasting focus.
