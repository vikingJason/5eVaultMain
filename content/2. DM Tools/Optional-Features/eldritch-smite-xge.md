# Eldritch Smite
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 56*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level, Pact of the Blade

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a warlock spell slot to deal an extra `1d8` force damage to the target, plus another `1d8` per level of the spell slot, and you can knock the target [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone) if it is Huge or smaller.
