# Chains from Hell (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 38*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

As an action, you manifest fiery chains that attempt to wrap around up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes `4d6` fire damage and is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the end of your next turn. On a success, a target takes half as much damage and isn't [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
