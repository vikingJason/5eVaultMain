# Doom Hound
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 135*  

**Prerequisite**: 7th-level, Pact of the Chain, "Primordial" Patron

As a bonus action, your familiar transforms into a more powerful creature for 1 minute. At 7th level and higher, it transforms into a [dire wolf](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/dire-wolf.md). At 12th level and higher, it transforms into a [winter wolf](2-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/winter-wolf.md). At 18th level and higher, it transforms into a hound of the night (see Tome of Beasts). You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this invocation on your familiar again.
