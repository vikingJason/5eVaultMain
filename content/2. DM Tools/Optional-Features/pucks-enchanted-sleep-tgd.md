# Puck's Enchanted Sleep
*Source: The Great Dale*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level, "The Archfey" Patron

You can cast [catnap](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/catnap-xge.md) once without using a spell slot. When you do so, you can target a number of willing creatures as if you had cast the spell using a warlock spell slot, and you can include yourself without counting against the number of targets. If you do, you remain aware of your surroundings using your passive Perception score and can end the spell on yourself early at will; you are otherwise treated as unconscious.
