# Putredine
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 260*  

*The rune of decay*

**Type**: Damage Rune

**Representation**: Necrotic

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *putredine* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell that deals damage that isn't necrotic, change the spell's damage type to necrotic. Once used to change the damage type of three spells, *putredine* can't be used this way again until you finish a long rest.
