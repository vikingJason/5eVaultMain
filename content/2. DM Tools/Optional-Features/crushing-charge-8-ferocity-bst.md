# Crushing Charge (8 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29*  

**Prerequisite**: 10th-level

As an action, you move up to your speed in a straight line without provoking opportunity attacks. You can move through other creatures' spaces, but must end your move in an unoccupied space. Each creature in a space you move through, except for your companion, must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes `4d6` bludgeoning damage and is knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone). On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
