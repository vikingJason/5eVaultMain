# Wrath of the Pack (4 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 29*  

**Prerequisite**: 10th-level

When you hit a creature with an attack and that creature is within 5 feet of your companion, you can have your companion make a signature attack against the creature (no action required). On a hit, the attack deals its normal effects, and the target is knocked [prone](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone).
