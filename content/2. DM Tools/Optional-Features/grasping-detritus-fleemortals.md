# Grasping Detritus
*Source: Flee, Mortals! p. 139*  

**Prerequisite**: Sea Hag in a Coven

(Recharge 5-6) The hag conjures magical seaweed and fish guts to restrain their foes. Each enemy in a 30-foot cone emanating from the hag must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 13 (`3d8`) bludgeoning damage and is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the end of the hag's next turn. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage and isn't [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).
