# Grappling Strike
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 42*  

Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and then try to grapple the target as a bonus action (see the Player's Handbook for rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength ([Athletics](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.
