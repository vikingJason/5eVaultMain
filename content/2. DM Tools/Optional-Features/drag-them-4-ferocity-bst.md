# Drag Them (4 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 28*  

**Prerequisite**: 2nd-level

When your companion hits a Large or smaller creature with their signature attack and both the companion and the target are standing on the ground, you can use your reaction to command your companion to move the target. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the companion moves up to half their walking speed in any direction you choose and pulls the target with it.
