*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 258*  

*The rune of ambition*

**Type**: Range Rune

**Representation**: 120 feet to 500 feet

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *gloria* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a range of 120 to 500 feet, increase the spell's range by half. For example, if you cast a spell that normally has a range of 120 feet, it has a range of 180 feet when you use this rune as a spellcasting focus.
