# Fleet of Foot
*Source: Total Party Kill Bestiary - Vol. 1 p. 50*  

The beast's speed increases by 30 feet and it may take the [Dash](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) or [Disengage](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Disengage) actions as a bonus action. Additionally, the beast can spend 5 feet of movement to free itself from nonmagical restraints or a grapple.
