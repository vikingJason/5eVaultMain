# Unarmed
*Source: Rule of Law v2.2a*  

Your unarmed strike uses a d4 for damage. (This benefit has no effect if another feature has already improved your unarmed strike's die.) When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike on your turn you can make one additional unarmed strike as a bonus action.
