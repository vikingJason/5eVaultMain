# Ghostly Gaze
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 56*  

**Prerequisite**: 7th-level

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have [darkvision](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/senses.md#darkvision) if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your [concentration](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
