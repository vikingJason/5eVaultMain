# Proelium
*Source: Tome of Heroes p. 260*  

*The rune of combat*

**Type**: Duration Rune

**Representation**: 1 minute to 59 minutes

**Spellcasting Focus**: When you use *proelium* as a spellcasting focus while casting a spell with a duration of 1 to 10 minutes, double the spell's duration. For example, a spell that lasts 1 minute lasts 2 minutes when you use this rune as a spellcasting focus. If the spell requires concentration, you must still maintain concentration.
