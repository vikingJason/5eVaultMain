# Essence of Octopus
*Source: Total Party Kill Bestiary - Vol. 1 p. 16*  

## Benefits

### Cunning of the Depths

The hybrid has a +2 bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Wisdom.

### Increased Fortitude

The hybrid has five additional Hit Dice, and its hit point maximum is increased by 32 plus its Constitution modifier, multiplied by 5.

### Octopus Biology

The hybrid has a swim speed equal to its speed, it has proficiency in Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) cability checks, and it has the Ink Cloud and Tentacles actoins.

### Underwater Camouflage (Trait)

The hybrid has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) ability checks while underwater.

### Water Breathing (Trait)

The hybrid can breathe underwater.

## Actions

### Ink Cloud (1/Short or Long Rest)

A 40-foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the hybrid if it is underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the hybrid can use the [Dash](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/actions.md#Dash) action as a bonus action.

### Tentacles

*Melee Weapon Attack:* +(Strength modifier + proficiency bonus) to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:*  (`3d6` + Strength modifier) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is [grappled](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC [10 + Strength modifier + proficiency bonus]). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the hybrid can't use its tentacles on another target.
