# Twinned Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 102. Available in the SRD.*  

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, [magic missile](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/magic-missile.md) and [scorching ray](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/scorching-ray.md) aren't eligible, but [ray of frost](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/ray-of-frost.md) and [chromatic orb](2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/chromatic-orb.md) are.
