# Stinging Swarm (6 Ferocity)
*Source: MCDM - Beastheart and Monstrous Companions p. 41*  

**Prerequisite**: 11th-level

As an action, you conjure a swarm of stinging insects in a line that is 5 feet wide and 30 feet long. Each creature in the line except your companion must make a Constitution saving throw, taking `4d6` piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The insects then dissolve to shadow and fade away.

When you reach 17th level, the damage increases to `5d6`.
