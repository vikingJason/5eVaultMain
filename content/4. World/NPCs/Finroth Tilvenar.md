## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Finroth stands tall and slender with the ethereal grace typical of the Eladrin. His once-vibrant green eyes have dulled to a more somber hue, reflecting his calculated nature. His skin has a pale, almost ghostly quality, and his blonde hair is streaked with silver. He is often seen wearing elegant, dark green robes adorned with gold embroidery. A silver pendant, a relic from his late wife Elara, hangs around his neck, and he carries a cane with a jewel-encrusted head shaped like a dragon.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Finroth is very charismatic, frequently talking about the importance of teamwork and community. He often fiddles with his pendant when in deep thought or stressed, a habit that betrays his otherwise composed demeanor. Though he carries a cane, it is more a symbol of authority than a necessity for mobility.
