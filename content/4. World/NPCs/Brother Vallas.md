## **Traits**

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Brother Vallas is tall and gaunt, with pallid skin that seems to shimmer faintly in the moonlight. His silver hair flows like liquid light, always framing his soft, welcoming face. His eyes, seemingly kind, have irises that faintly glow an unnatural violet when under direct moonlight. Around his neck is a crescent moon amulet, marked with subtle but warped runes of Kalistyr’s power.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Brother Vallas speaks in measured, honeyed tones, often quoting hymns to Sehanine. He gazes deeply into people’s eyes as if looking into their soul. When angered or cornered, his voice deepens unnaturally, and his language subtly shifts to ominous phrases.  
> > [!quote] ***"Child of the night, do not fear. Your dreams are safe within Sehanine’s embrace… though the shadows may seek to test your faith."***

<br>

## **Personality**

> [!recite|title-Center] **World View**
> Brother Vallas sees himself as an agent of balance—twisting people’s faith and dreams to siphon their strength for Kalistyr. He believes that suffering is a divine purification process, and his role is to deliver it subtly through whispered terror.  
> 
> > [!warning]
> > **Social DC Impact:** Convincing Vallas to reveal his true motives is difficult (DC 18 Persuasion or Insight), as he is adept at weaving lies into comforting half-truths about Sehanine’s mysterious ways. His veneer cracks if the party references his amulet’s runes or confront him with proof of Kalistyr’s influence (DC 14 Intimidation).

<br>

> [!warning] **Potential Quest hook**
> Villagers suffering from nightmares or sleepwalking are drawn to Brother Vallas’s chapel for help. In truth, Vallas manipulates their dreams, harvesting fear to empower Kalistyr. The party must uncover his deception, either by investigating the nightmares or deciphering the corrupted runes on his holy symbols.


### **Dark Secrets**

- **Kalistyr’s Influence:** The crescent moon on his amulet is a warped symbol of Sehanine, its runes channeling psychic energy to Kalistyr. Insightful characters (DC 18 Arcana) can detect its corrupt nature.
- **Ritual Chamber:** Beneath the chapel lies a hidden chamber, its walls carved with runes depicting dream-consuming rituals.

### **Potential Player Interactions**

- **Nightmare Connection:** Affected party members may experience recurring nightmares where Vallas’s voice whispers ominous prayers.
- **Destroying the Amulet:** Removing or destroying the amulet weakens Vallas, reducing his spell save DC by 2 and cutting off his connection to Kalistyr.



## **Location Details**

> [!abstract|background-color-orange] **Chapel of the Silver Moon** **Exterior:** A crumbling stone structure overgrown with ivy, adorned with faintly glowing crescent moon carvings. By day, it seems peaceful, but at night, the carvings warp into jagged, shadowy forms.  
> **Interior:** Rows of old wooden pews face a cracked altar. Moonlight spills through shattered stained glass, casting eerie patterns on the floor. Hidden trapdoors lead to the underground ritual chamber.
