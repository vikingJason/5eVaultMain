Yoruna Faede

Anxious Noble

*“Perhaps we should leave together. I'm quite certain I could find someway to be of use to you. Why don't you buy me a drink and we can discuss it further."*

**Appearance:** Just past her prime, Yoruna’s body is soft from a comfortable life; she vainly hides her wrinkles under powder. She dresses conservatively and has an aura of command about her.

**Roleplaying:** She has a nonthreatening demeanor but speaks with a quiet menace. While not impulsive, Yoruna wants to put her plans in motion as quickly as possible. She fears that her cousin will return too soon and ruin her takeover.

**Personality:** Yoruna is pleasant as long as things are going in her favor. She is constantly brooding over whether she can complete her goals in time.

**Motivation:** She wants to be queen and isn’t afraid to crush or sleep with anyone to achieve her goal.

**Background:** Ambitious from birth, Yoruna has always believed herself to be above her current standing. Always seeking the finer things in life she was attracted to the quick wins associated with her profession. With her youth now fading she is keen to obtain a better more comfortable life by any means possible.

**Traits:** *(WC) Dilettante, leader, political, power hungry*
