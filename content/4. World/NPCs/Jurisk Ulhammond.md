Jurisk (CG male human rogue 5/fighter 8/vigilante 1) is a mousy-looking with a thin, prematurely gray hair who looks much older than his age. He favors ink-stained robes and endless cups of boiling hot tea. Jurisk is a moneylender and the leader of a Trades Ward cell. As one of the most trusted lieutenants of "the One," Jurisk is only one of two [[Red Sashes]] who knows that Durnan is "the One."

By chance, Jurisk fell afoul of a greater doppelganger of the [Unseen](http://www.realmshelps.net/faerun/organizations/waterdeep6.shtml#unseen) one month ago during while indulging in a visit with his favorite courtesan. Jurisk's identity is now a facade for Ptola, one of Hlaavin's lieutenants. The Unseen are only beginning to decide what to do with these newly verified suspicions, but it will almost certainly play into Hlaavin's efforts to manipulate the Lords of Waterdeep.
