**URT, THE IRONGUT**

*Male half-orc drunkard*

<u>Appearance</u>

Urt is large and imposing, a brute with pale green skin, a pressed nose, and jowls that highlight small tusks common among his species. He is perpetually drunk or drinking, and carries the smell of dirt and alcohol with him as commonly as a bottle. Despite his condition, he is typically considered friendly company, always willing to join in a song or a jape provided he’s sober enough to stand.

<u>The Best Disguise</u>

Urt’s true duty requires him to collect information and secrets. Urt reports to a powerful underground organization that deals explicitly in knowledge and all of its uses. The half-orc has found his best disguise is his persona that parades around as an innocuous drunkard.

<u>Personality, Quirks, & Memorable Features</u>

No one really knows where the half-orc Urt came from; certainly no one has any impression that he’s heading anywhere. The fact that Urt can be so commonplace without others giving him a thought works to his advantage.

While this role may require him to partake of his fair share of drinks, Urt’s real talent is that of a dubious actor, collecting secrets passed in alleyways and taverns while he pretends to be in a drunken stupor.

Urt absolutely detests anyone that belittles or mistreats him because of his race. His heritage is generally a mystery among the populace, and people have found the half-orc is much more pleasant drowning in a bottle than when his wrath is stoked.
