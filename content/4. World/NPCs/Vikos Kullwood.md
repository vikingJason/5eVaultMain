Vikos Kullwood

Reformed Thug

*“I should kill you, but I’m a nice guy now. We’ll be friends, instead.”*

**Appearance:** Vikos is seven feet tall and wears his hair in a shambled mess. His face is heavily scarred, and he looks weary beyond his years.

**Roleplaying:** Vikos speaks in short, clipped sentences. He always takes the shortest route to his goal, obstacles notwithstanding.

**Personality:** Vikos is a simple man who takes pleasure in hitting things and who likes to take a direct route through life. He practices meditation, and now has a very long fuse. Until the end of that fuse is reached, he’s a gentle giant; set him off, and he’s a holy terror.

**Motivation:** Vikos wants to lead a peaceful, untroubled life, and he tries to help others as a way of atoning for the sins of his past.

**Background:** Formerly a thug and blackguard through and through, Vikos once sacked a temple and forced the oracle to tell his fortune. He never speaks of what he saw in his vision, but from that day forward he was a changed man. After traveling to a new land, he began trying to wipe out his past by committing good deeds in the present. Every so often, his true nature emerges again—with disastrous consequences. He remains a fighter by trade, and a supreme badass, but now he fights only for causes he believes in, rather than just for money.

**Traits:** *(MR) Adventurer, outdoorsman, warrior*
