> [!info|bg-c-purple] Overview
> Vallas is a deceptive and cunning figure who masquerades as a priest of Sehanine, the goddess of the moon and illusions, while secretly working for a local Thieves' Guild. He uses his priestly guise to gain the trust of others, especially vulnerable travelers and adventurers, only to manipulate them for his own gain. Despite his dark nature, Vallas is charming and charismatic, always smiling while hiding his true intentions.

## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Vallas is a tall, slim man with short-cropped dark hair and sharp, angular features. His eyes are an icy blue that seem to glimmer with hidden malice, though his soft expression often masks it. He wears simple priest robes of Sehanine, white with silver accents, but always keeps a concealed dagger and a set of lockpicks hidden beneath his vestments.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Vallas speaks in a calm, reassuring tone, often placing a gentle hand on a shoulder to offer "comfort" when speaking with someone. His body language is relaxed and welcoming, but his eyes are always assessing, seeking the next opportunity to exploit.
>> [!quote] *"The moon guides us all... but some of us must walk its shadowed paths."*

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Abilities**
> Vallas is a skilled liar and manipulator, able to easily charm or deceive others with his words. He is also an expert in stealth and pickpocketing, with strong connections in the local Thieves’ Guild. Though he carries the guise of a peaceful priest, he can defend himself with his hidden dagger and quick reflexes.

## Personality

> [!recite|title-Center] **World View**
> Vallas believes that trust is a commodity to be bought and sold, and that those who show too much trust or faith are the easiest marks. He sees the world as a place where only the clever survive and prosper, and his allegiance to Sehanine is purely for his personal gain, using her name to veil his actions in righteousness.
>
> > [!warning] ***Social interactions with Vallas are often deceitful, and he will try to manipulate players to suit his needs. Insight checks against his deception may be difficult (DC 16).***

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Motivations**
> Vallas is motivated by wealth and power. He enjoys the thrill of manipulating others and getting away with his deceptions, and he hopes to climb higher within the ranks of the Thieves’ Guild, using his position as a "priest" to secure new marks for the guild.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Ideals**
> - **Cunning**: Vallas believes that only the clever survive, and outwitting others is the key to his success.
> - **Independence**: He dislikes authority over him but respects the hierarchy of the Thieves’ Guild due to its power and utility.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Bonds**
> Vallas is secretly loyal to the Thieves’ Guild and its leader, who gave him the priestly role as part of a larger scheme to control the city's underworld.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Flaw**
> Vallas is paranoid, always fearing that someone will uncover his ruse. This paranoia sometimes causes him to make mistakes or become too defensive when questioned.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Secrets**
> Vallas secretly resents his position in the guild and seeks a way to overthrow its leader, though he has yet to find the right opportunity or ally to do so.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Goals**
> His short-term goal is to pull off a major heist for the guild, while his long-term ambition is to gather enough wealth and influence to leave the city and start his own criminal empire elsewhere.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Likes/Dislikes**
> ***Likes:***  
> Wealth, intrigue, and the thrill of deceiving others.
>

<br>

> [!warning] **Useful Information**
> Vallas will often try to charm and deceive adventurers into doing work for him or the guild, under the guise of divine missions for Sehanine. If the players catch on to his deception, he will attempt to flee or use his guild connections to eliminate them.

> [!kith|antagonist]  **Rivals**

<br>

> [!warning] **Potential Quest hook**
> The players may encounter Vallas as a helpful priest offering aid. He may send them on false errands or ask for help in "recovering sacred relics" (which are, in fact, valuable stolen goods). If the players discover his true identity, they may expose him, confront the Thieves’ Guild, or even be manipulated into doing his dirty work for their own gain.

> [!tip] **Inspiration**
