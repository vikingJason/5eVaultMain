## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Rhyvesh is tall and slender, with the shadowy, ethereal appearance typical of a Darkling Elder. His skin is an ashen grey, his eyes are a piercing violet, and his hair is a cascade of dark tendrils that seem to blend into the shadows around him. He wears elaborate robes adorned with ancient Fae symbols and carries an air of quiet menace.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Rhyvesh often moves with a fluid, almost unnatural grace. He frequently fiddles with his pendant when in deep thought or stressed and speaks in a calm, calculated tone with a hint of charismatic passion.
