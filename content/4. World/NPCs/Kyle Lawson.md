Kyle Lawson

Nightmare Busybody

*“You really ought to stop drinking so much. Someday someone’s going to get hurt...”*

**Appearance:** Though chubby and seemingly ill at ease most of the time, Kyle’s smile is broad and inviting, and he dresses cleanly, if not fashionably.

**Roleplaying:** Kyle’s always ready with a smile, a kind word, whatever help he can provide, and an attentive ear.

**Personality:** He’s pleasant and caring. Due to severe psychosis, he believes he knows what’s best for everyone around him, and that he has a duty to help them improve no matter what it takes. Experience has taught him that this works best when no one knows that he’s behind their difficult learning experiences.

**Motivation:** Kyle wants to share his “wisdom” with everyone and teach them the lessons they need to learn.

**Background:** Kyle’s parents were always right, and if he had just listened, they wouldn’t have had to punish him so severely. Now that he’s learned to be good, it’s his turn to teach everyone else the way he was taught. Kyle wishes they’d just listen to him, but that doesn’t work. In time he’s discovered that people learn best when he arranges “accidents” that teach them the folly of their actions. Most of the time Kyle is completely delusional about himself, but he has dark moments when he realizes that his parents were monsters and he’s no better; these moments are incredibly dangerous to those around him.

**Traits:** *(MN) Abhorrent, genius*
