## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Calarel is an elegant elven woman with long, silver hair that flows down to her waist, often adorned with delicate braids and tiny silver charms. Her eyes are a deep emerald green, always alert and filled with curiosity. She is slender and tall, with an aura of quiet grace that is typical of her kind. Calarel is known for wearing distinctive jewelry—particularly a set of intricate silver rings and bracelets that jingle softly as she moves. These pieces, often Elven heirlooms or artifacts she has studied, are as much a part of her as her keen intellect.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Calarel is constantly in motion, fidgeting with her rings or pacing as she ponders over the archives' contents or the mysteries she is trying to unravel. When speaking, she often taps her fingers together or gestures with her hands, a habit developed from centuries of turning pages and examining ancient scrolls.
> > [!quote] "The truth is like a tapestry, woven from countless threads of knowledge. We must be patient as we unravel it."

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Abilities**
> Calarel is fluent in multiple languages, including Common, Elvish, Dwarvish, Draconic, and several ancient tongues. Her extensive knowledge of history, magic, and lore makes her an invaluable resource to the queen and anyone seeking information. She has a near-photographic memory, able to recall even the most obscure details from the archives. Additionally, she possesses a minor aptitude for divination magic, which she uses sparingly to aid her research.
