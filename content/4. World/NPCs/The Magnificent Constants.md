<br>

## Personality

> Constants believes art is the highest form of expression, and those who cannot appreciate it are beneath him. He sees himself as a gift to the world and revels in his ability to captivate others.
> 
> > [!warning]
> > ***His smug attitude may make it harder for players to earn his respect without demonstrating artistic talent or wit.***

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Motivations**
> To be recognized as the greatest puppeteer in the world.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Ideals**
> Creativity, expression, and the transformative power of performance.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Bonds**
> He holds deep sentimental value for his first puppet, "Chanterelle," a wooden marionette shaped like a mushroom.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Flaw**
> His arrogance can blind him to genuine criticism or danger.

<br>

> [!warning] **Useful Information**

<br>

<br>

> [!timeline|title-Centre] **Notable History**
> - 20 years ago, he won a prestigious performance contest, earning him fame.
> - Developed his magical puppetry skills after encountering a mysterious dryad who taught him the art of binding essence to wood.

<br>

> [!example] **Inventory**
> - Magical puppets (various, including "Chanterelle" and "Harlequin")
> - Ornate cane (functions as a spellcasting focus)
> - A collection of finely tailored vests and top hats
> - Small enchanted music box for ambiance during performances

<br>

> [!warning] **Potential Quest hook**
> Constants needs help retrieving rare, magical wood from an enchanted forest to craft a new masterpiece. The forest, however, is said to be cursed and guarded by vengeful spirits.

<br>

> [!tip] **Inspiration**
> ***Compare this NPC to a mix of "The Great Ziegfeld" and "Howl" from *Howl's Moving Castle*—extravagant, talented, and slightly egotistical.***
