Marla Erets

Jaded Nepotist

*“Ugh…whips are so last week.”*

**Appearance:** A beanpole of a woman with wide-set fishy eyes and sharp features, Marla isn’t much to look at. She often wears tight gowns that emphasize her androgynous figure.

**Roleplaying:** Marla fancies herself a vamp and isn’t particular about who she cuddles up to. Spurning her affections, or refusing a proffered vice, often sends Marla into a tantrum.

**Personality:** Though she readily indulges her every whim, old experiences hold little excitement for Marla and she’s constantly on the lookout for something new.

**Motivation:** Marla is petty and childish. She wants to grab and play with any new toy that she sees, and she wants to always get her way.

**Background:** Spoiled rotten by her rich and influential parents, Marla was handed everything on a silver platter from birth. She eventually became such a nuisance that she was given a position in charge of the city guard to get her out from underfoot. This proved to be an enormous mistake. She immediately began abusing her position, using the guard as her personal goon squad, and turning headquarters into a private hedonists’ playground. There’s a chance that she just wants acceptance, understanding, or the love of her parents. If so, it’s buried so far down that no one ever sees it. Not even Marla.

**Traits:** *(MN) Dilettante, notorious, police, wealthy*
