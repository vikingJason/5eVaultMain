## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description** 
> A gaunt and spectral figure with pale, silver-tinged skin. Her long, disheveled black hair seems to shimmer faintly, as though reflecting distant starlight. Her once-bright lavender eyes have dulled to a shadowy gray, and faint scars in crescent shapes line her face and arms. She carries a broken holy symbol of Sehanine around her neck, tarnished and corrupted with blackened veins of Kalistyr's influence.

> [!recite|title-Center] **Mannerisms**
> 
> - Frequently mutters fragmented prayers, mixing phrases from both Sehanine and Kalistyr.
> - Clutches her holy symbol whenever she feels threatened or overwhelmed.
> - Her speech is melodic but often tinged with bitterness or sorrow.
> 
> > [!quote] _"Justice? You speak of justice as though it is a gift, not a punishment... Tell me, does it hurt to bear such faith?"_

## Personality

> [!recite|title-Center] **World View** 
> Seralith once believed in Sehanine's principles of justice and hope, but her resolve was tested beyond its limits. Now, she views faith as a cruel joke played by the gods, a tool to manipulate mortals. She seeks solace in Kalistyr's promises of power and revenge.
> 
> > [!warning]  
> > _**Interactions with players may be challenging, requiring them to prove the sincerity of their faith or intentions. Her bitterness could set DCs for social interaction between 15-20, depending on the approach.**_

## Backstory

Seralith Veylindar was once a devoted cleric of Sehanine Moonbow, serving in an isolated temple known as the **Moonshadow Ruins.** Her life was dedicated to guiding lost souls, healing the wounded, and protecting the innocent. However, during a particularly harrowing event, the temple fell under siege by a powerful undead force that could not be stopped.

When the templeâ€™s defenders fell, Seralith prayed desperately for Sehanine's intervention, but none came. Believing herself abandoned, Seralith was found by a seductive voice in the shadows: Kalistyr. In her moment of despair, Seralith accepted the dark goddess's offer of power to protect herself and the temple. However, this power came at a terrible cost. Corrupted by Kalistyr's influence, Seralith was consumed by jealousy and rage, driving her to slaughter both invaders and her fellow acolytes who tried to stop her.

Her transformation into the **Lunar Shade** was the final punishment for her betrayal of Sehanine's principles. Her body was left to decay in the ruins, but her hatred and force of will allowed her to persist in a corrupted undead form, bound to the dark whispers of Kalistyr.

## Potential Role in the Campaign

1. **Tragic Antagonist:** The players might encounter Seralith as the **Lunar Shade** but uncover her history through visions, journals, or surviving relics. They could attempt to redeem her by reigniting her faith in Sehanine or defeating her to put her soul to rest.
2. **Quest Giver:** Before her transformation, Seralith could have hidden artifacts of Sehanine that the party must retrieve, requiring them to delve into her tragic history.
3. **Moral Dilemma:** The players might discover that Seralith is still partially conscious within the Lunar Shade and could potentially be saved at great personal risk.

## Traits and Hooks

> [!warning] **Potential Quest Hook**
> 
> - A local priest of Sehanine asks the party to investigate strange happenings at the **Moonshadow Ruins**, where a spirit calling herself the "Warden of the Night" has been luring travelers to their deaths.
> - Kalistyr's growing influence threatens Sehanine's followers, and the party must stop Seralith before the corruption spreads.
> - A magical artifact tied to Sehanine lies within the ruins, but it can only be accessed by appeasing or defeating Seralith.
