Douglas Green

Avaricious Merchant

*“A sword is precious in a town under siege. Thirty-five gold—unless you test my patience by haggling.”*

**Appearance:** Douglas is a twig of a man, vibrating with nervous energy and exotic stimulants. He dresses richly, advertising his wealth, and has a hawk’s gaze.

**Roleplaying:** His voice is high and nasal, and he spits out numbers so fast is seems like he’s stuttering. He has all the cards and knows it; sly smiles and serious appraisal alternate across his face.

**Personality:** Profit is all. He’s ready for a lifetime of luxury and willing to cut out any obstacle in the way. Money will buy everything he lacks—and those who can’t see that don’t deserve to be in business.

**Motivation:** Douglas grew up the son of a tinkerer, spat upon and constantly roving, doing odd jobs for a meal. He’s never going back to that! He has to buy friends and companionship, so he’d better have money enough to keep them.

**Background:** His father made the trade of a lifetime, getting Douglas an apprenticeship in the merchants’ guild. Most of the guild shunned his teacher, but he taught Douglas several key theories and let the child read books about trade. Douglas mastered them and noted that crisis makes or breaks a merchant. He orchestrates crises to ensure that his goods are in demand, working with bandits and unsavory sorts to eliminate competition and keep a city desperate.

**Traits:** *(SM) Academic, aggressive, merchant*
