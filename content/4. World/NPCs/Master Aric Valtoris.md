## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Master Aric stands at 5'10" with a lean, muscular build that speaks of a lifetime of physical labor. His skin is tanned from the heat of the forge, and his hair, once dark, is now streaked with silver. His piercing blue eyes are sharp and observant, often catching details others might miss. He has a neatly trimmed beard that matches the color of his hair, and his hands are calloused and scarred from years of work.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Aric speaks with a calm and measured tone, his words carefully chosen and delivered with precision. He has a habit of rubbing his chin when deep in thought, and his gaze often drifts to the weapons in his shop, as if mentally cataloging their details.
