> ### **Traits**
> 
> _**Shadow Merge.**_ As a bonus action, the Lunar Shade can disappear into a shadow within 60 feet and reappear in another shadow within range at the start of its next turn. While merged with a shadow, it is immune to all damage except radiant. This ability cannot be used while the Lunar Shade is in direct moonlight.
> 
> _**Lunar Resilience.**_ While in direct moonlight, the Lunar Shade's AC is reduced by 2, and it becomes vulnerable to all damage except radiant.
> 
> _**Aura of Dread.**_ Creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of the Lunar Shade must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom saving throw** or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the save at the end of its turn.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Actions**
> 
> _**Multiattack.**_ The Lunar Shade makes three attacks: two with **Shadow Lash** and one with **Moonlight Bolt** (if available).
> 
> _**Shadow Lash.**_ _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.  
> _Hit:_ 17 (3d8 + 4) necrotic damage. If the target is frightened, it takes an additional 7 (2d6) psychic damage.
> 
> _**Moonlight Bolt (Recharge 5–6).**_ _Ranged Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.  
> _Hit:_ 18 (4d8) radiant damage. A creature hit by this attack must succeed on a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or be blinded until the end of its next turn.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Special Abilities**
> 
> _**Lunar Pulse (Recharge 5–6).**_ The Lunar Shade releases a wave of corrupt moonlight. All creatures within a 30-foot radius must make a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or take 22 (5d8) radiant damage and be blinded until the end of their next turn. Creatures in direct moonlight make this saving throw with disadvantage.
> 
> _**Soul Drain (Recharge 6).**_ The Lunar Shade targets a creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a **DC 16 Constitution saving throw** or take 27 (6d8) necrotic damage. The Lunar Shade regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt.
>

> 
> ### **Legendary Actions**
> 
> The Lunar Shade can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn.
> 
> - **Shadow Step.** The Lunar Shade teleports to an unoccupied space within 60 feet that it can see.
> - **Necrotic Burst (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within 10 feet of the Lunar Shade must succeed on a **DC 16 Dexterity saving throw** or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.

### Adjusted Tactics for a Deadly Encounter:

- The **Aura of Dread** creates additional pressure on the party, forcing Wisdom saves that may hinder melee characters.
- **Lunar Pulse** adds high burst damage to punish grouped players.
- **Soul Drain** allows the Lunar Shade to recover HP, extending the encounter's duration and increasing its threat level.
- The Legendary Actions give it more mobility and damage potential, allowing it to keep pressure on the party.

This version of the **Lunar Shade** should provide a deadly challenge to a party of six level 5 characters. Let me know if you want further adjustments!
