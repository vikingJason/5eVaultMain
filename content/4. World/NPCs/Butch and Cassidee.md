## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> 
> **Butch:** Butch is a rugged, middle-aged man with a face as weathered as an old leather coat. His intense brown eyes are like embers, always watching and taking in every detail. He stands tall with a lean, muscular build, often seen wearing a long, dark coat that has seen countless miles on the road. His voice is low and gravelly, matching his rough exterior.
>
> **Cassidee:** Cassidee is a young, vibrant half-elf with long, blonde hair often hidden beneath a green hood. Her sharp features and keen, bright eyes give her an air of alertness. She carries a crossbow with her at all times, slung casually over her shoulder. Her movements are quick and precise, and she dresses in a mix of leather and green cloth, designed for both comfort and readiness.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> 
> **Butch:** Butch is a man of few words, often speaking only when necessary. His body language is closed off, giving the impression of a man who has seen much and trusts little.
> > [!quote] “Keep your eyes on the road, and your hands where I can see 'em.”
>
> **Cassidee:** Cassidee is more talkative, though she prefers to keep conversations light and non-committal. Her tone is always slightly playful, but there's an underlying sharpness to her words.
> > [!quote] “You never know what’s lurking in the shadows… but it’s usually something interesting.”

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Abilities**
> 
> **Butch:** Butch is an expert in handling horses and navigating difficult terrains. He has a keen sense of direction and is highly skilled in close-quarters combat, especially with a knife.
>
> **Cassidee:** Cassidee is a sharpshooter with her crossbow, rarely missing her target. She’s also adept at scouting and stealth, often using her half-elf heritage to blend into the woods and observe without being seen.
