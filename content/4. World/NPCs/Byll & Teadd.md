## Traits

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**

They have pale, almost luminescent skin, and their eyes shift in color depending on their emotions, typical of Eladrin.

They wear dark green cloaks that allow them to move silently through the woods, blending in with their surroundings.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Byll and Teadd often finish each other's sentences, and their communication is seamless, almost telepathic. They are soft-spoken and tend to stay on the outskirts of conversations, observing more than engaging.
