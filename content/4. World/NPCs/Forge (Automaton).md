# **Forge**

<br>

> [!info|bg-c-purple] Overview
>
> Forge is an ancient Automaton crafted for the purpose of blacksmithing. It has served in this role for centuries, working tirelessly in the heat of the forge.

<br>

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Forge is a large, humanoid automaton made of dark iron and bronze. Its body is built with the precision of a master craftsman, with powerful arms designed to handle the most intense heat and pressure. Glowing orange eyes peer out from a head that resembles a helmet, and its hands end in heavy, hammer-like appendages.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms/Behaviours**
> Forge is a creature of habit and efficiency. It moves with purpose and precision, wasting no energy on unnecessary motion. When not actively working, it stands in a state of quiet readiness, awaiting the next task. Forge rarely speaks, but when it does, its voice is a deep, resonant rumble.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Abilities**
> - **Master Smith:** Forge has unparalleled skill in blacksmithing, able to create weapons and armor of exceptional quality.
> - **Heat Resistance:** Forge can withstand extreme temperatures without damage, allowing it to work directly with molten metal.
> - **Endless Stamina:** Being an Automaton, Forge never tires and can work continuously without rest.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Social Structure**
> Forge is a solitary worker, designed to function independently. It does not require companionship or social interaction, though it recognizes the authority of its owner or operator.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Origin**
> Forge was created long ago by a master artificer to serve as a blacksmith in a bustling city. Over time, it has outlasted its creators and has become a fixture in Petalwood, where it continues its work in the village's forge.
