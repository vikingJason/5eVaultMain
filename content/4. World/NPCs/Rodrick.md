## Traits


> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> Redfang "Bloody" Rorick is a small, wiry figure with a hunched posture and an unsettling, predatory grin. His skin is a sickly grayish-green, and his blood-red cap is always soaked in the blood of his victims. He has sharp, jagged teeth and glowing red eyes that burn with malice. His hands and feet are clawed, and he carries a vicious sickle that drips with the blood of his enemies.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms**
> Rorick has a chilling, raspy voice and a tendency to cackle maniacally, especially when he sees blood. He moves with a jerky, almost insect-like gait, and his eyes dart around constantly, always on the lookout for potential threats or opportunities.
