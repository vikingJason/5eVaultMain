# Hammer of Moradin
## Overview
**Type**: Military
#Organization/Military

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Hammer]] of Moradin were a special prestige class on Faer√ªn for the dwarven worshipers of Moradin. Hammers of Moradin were members of an order of holy warriors, defending Citadel Adbar against the enemies of dwarves: goblinoids, giants and [[Drow|drow]]. Rather than simply defend the city walls, they left that work to the regular army of the Iron [[3. Mechanics/bestiary/humanoid/Guard]] and actively sought their enemies to destroy them and their homes. Very often they were helped by the order of explorers of [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]], the Deepscouts. To become a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Hammer|hammer]] of Moradin, a dwarf had to show great fighting skills and some degree of [[Chapter 10 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] ability.

## Philosophy
**Ex-Hammers of Moradin**

Those dwarves who violated their ethical alignment or betrays either Citadel Adbar or the hammers of Moradin as a whole lost all spell-like and supernatural abilities gained from the prestige class. They regained his abilities and advancement potential if they atoned for their actions.

## Additional Details
**Abilities**

As they became more powerful, hammers of Moradin gained earth-related abilites and powerful holy strikes.

**Aura of Courage**

Hammers of Moradin gained an aura of courage that functioned exactly like the paladin ability of the same name.

**[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Hammer]]**** Throw**

Hammers of Moradin could use their warhammer as a thrown weapon with a range of 20 feet. They took no additional penalties for using the weapon in this fashion.

**[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Hammer]]**** Return**

After becoming a bit more experienced, any warhammer thrown by Moradin's dwarves gained the returning ability. A returning warhammer flew through the air back to the thrower, returning so that it was ready to be used again.
