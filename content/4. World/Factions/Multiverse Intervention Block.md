### Motto
Whispers turn to thorns, the Eladrin shall learn

### Beliefs
* The natural order has been disrupted and the true potential of the Fae hindered. 
- The Eladrin's influence is a cancerous growth that must be excised.
- No act is too extreme if it helps realise our goals

### Goals
The Silent Adjudicators ultimately aim to establish a hidden dominion where the Fae subtly control Calindor from the shadows. They envision a world where Eladrin influence is diminished, major decisions are influenced by whispers from the Feywild, and the power rests firmly in the hands of the Fae creatures. They might achieve this through:

- **Weakening Eladrin Power:** Sabotage Eladrin infrastructure, sow discord within their society, and eliminate key figures.
- **Empowering Fae Influence:** Establish hidden sanctuaries for Fae creatures, forge alliances with sympathetic mortals, and subtly manipulate events to favor the Fae.
- **Controlling the Narrative:** Spread misinformation about the Eladrin and the Fae, discredit Eladrin leaders, and frame events to make the Fae appear benevolent saviors.

### Typical Quests


### Powers (Perks):

Unseen Inquisitors - send members on missions
Dread Shepherd - gain a follower
Nightshade Warden - safe passage/lodging
Thorned Claw - access to information, rumours


### Features
Features are used during the Intrigue phase granting additional abiltiies of the Organization.

### Activities
Activities that organizationis involved in, both past, current and future.
The Court generally avoids direct intervention in Calindor's affairs. However, if they perceive a grave threat to the Feywild, they might resort to more drastic measures, such as sabotage, misinformation campaigns, or even unleashing minor Fey creatures to create chaos and distract Calindorians.

### History/Background 

### Membership/Requirements
The Court is comprised entirely of Fey creatures, with a hierarchy that reflects the power structures within the Feywild. Red Caps, known for their cunning and adaptability, might serve as scouts and spies. Dryads, wise and long-lived, could act as advisors and keepers of ancient knowledge. More reclusive Fey, like Satyrs and Korreds, might hold positions of leadership, using their potent magic to manipulate events when necessary.
