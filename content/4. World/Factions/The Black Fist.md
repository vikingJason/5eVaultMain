## The Black Fist

**HQ:** Stojanow Gate, Phlan
**Purpose:** Mercenary, City Watch

Commanded by Lord Regent Ector Brahms, the Black Fist is charged with maintaining order and discipline in Phlan--a task they are not succeeding at.
Now that martial law has been declared in Phlan, the Knights of the Black Fist have been empowered to act as judge, jury, and executioner in carrying out the Lord Regent's will. The Black Fist dispenses justice quickly and harshly, and the organization is both feared and reviled by the citizenry of Phlan. The lower ranks of the order are rife with corruption, and the acceptance of bribes is commonplace.

Although the organization officially severed ties with the Temple of Bael many years ago, it is not uncommon to hear individual members of the Black Fist still paying lip service to the god to whom they once owed allegiance.
