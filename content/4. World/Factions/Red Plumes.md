The Red Plumes was a mercenary army of warriors that operated directly under the will of First Lord Maalthiir. They enforced his will within the walls of Hillsfar, even going so far as to harass its inhabitants, while regularly extorting them, in order to maintain a fear of his authority. They understood their limits however, never going as far as to warrant complaints that could be overheard by the First Lord.

> Yes, then we'll have found the Red Death," Olive growled. "That's what Maalthir's mercenaries are called among my people. Under his orders, they carried out a campaign to purge Hillsfar of thieves. Human thieves could hide, but all halflings were thieves, as far as Maalthir's Red Death was concerned. They drove every halfling from the city in the middle of the night, forced them to leave their valuables behind, didn't even give them a chance to sell the land or shops they owned.

Along with guarding the city, patrols of the Red Plumes could often be found keeping an eye open for monsters, members of the Zhentarim, or other threats.

History
Red Plumes were driven out of Hillsfar in 1376 DR by forces from Zhentil Keep. However, after three years of chaos, Maalthiir returned with a new force of Red Plumes and took back the rulership of the city. As of 1460 DR, Red Plumes maintained their presence in Hillsfar.
