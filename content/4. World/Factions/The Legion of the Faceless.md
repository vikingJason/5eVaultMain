Part of Nox's newfound gifts include the ability to alter his physical form, think a more advanced version of Alter Self that is just sorta whenever he wills it. Nox doesn't really know who he is without Lester, or Reeva, or Dorgle, so he just tries to be... someone else!

He's a dashing human sellsword for a time, a gnarly looking gnoll under the earth for a bit. He takes up swashbuckling to see all the fuss Reeva made about being a pirate, masquerading as Aveer, a raunchy and incredibly handsy female elven sailor. He gravitates towards the persona of holy men and women, often becoming monks or clerics that serve the local gods as he meanders around Faerun.

Only one old enemy seems to be following him wherever he goes. The Faceless Legion. They see through his ruse, and are keen on collecting a debt that was never quite paid. Nox chips away at their ranks over the years, Lester's power making him an incredible challenge for the assassins. Eventually, he narrows down the centre of their power in the Material Plane and, armed with a small squadron of Dorgles, cuts the head off the snake.

But being other people didn't seem to work, and now Nox had himself, a leaderless group of assassins, and a group of dorgles to scheme with! Enter: The new leader of the Faceless Legion, Nox, the Faceless Lord.

Nox had, over the years, run into a fellow shapechanger, a man by the name of Bumbell. Bumbell was technically a changeling, but had been Fey-cursed so that he could only ever adopt the form of goblins. Theirs was a complicated, occasionally tense, usually sexual relationship. Something close to romantic. Bumbell lived in Glitterfall, and as well as being Nox's eyes and ears in the capital, supplied Nox with Fey touched parchment.

Nox made all members of the Faceless Legion, new and old, sign contracts on this parchment, which bound them as though they were in the Feywild.

The assassins of the Faceless Legion became far more literal in their bearing. Their contract stipulated the gave up their physical form, becoming blank doppelgangers, and that while they retained individual personalities, they could never strike out against Nox. Creating so many magical shapeshifting creatures at once undoubtedly caused issues, and most Legion assassins were quite mad, becoming shadows of themselves. It didn't really matter, they were bound to kill only those who had names taken, and couldn't turn on Nox. Nox, meanwhile, had grown comfortable, settling into his role as master scryer and spy master over Reeva's realm and New-New-Phandalin.

His shackles fell off one day and he didn't even notice it. Old Nox probably never would have done something as overtly insane as run an assassin league, but Nox imbued with a Devil's power didn't care. He had finally made something of himself, by himself. And he even had a kinda boyfriend. It was all going well.

Then Calandor moved outside of the Fey.

And all of the Fey touched contracts... stopped working. The mad doppelgangers Nox made were no longer sworn to him, and no longer sworn to taking only the lives of the names they had. Across Calandor and the Material Plane, a plague of shapechanging, flesh eating beasts began to grow, the new Faceless Legion, working towards a goal beyond Nox's knowledge.

He'd probably be fine just quietly leaving the Material Plane, relaxing in the cushy little spot he made for himself in Hell. But the Legion remembers Nox. And they are not happy. So now Nox is scrambling, trying to find a way to supress the Faceless Legion. He also has a kinda? Warlock bound to him, which ties to his egg, but I can tell you about that later when it's not stupid late ha


The Clandestine Insurgency Associates

A group that are now part of a hivemind after their Fey Contracts with Nox as part of the Faceless Legion was altered when Calindor was relocated from the Feywilds.

This group is now hell bent of exacting chaos on the world, the same kind of chaos Nox was fond of, but elevated to a new and dangerous level. Destabilising Kingdoms from within. The CIA is now spread throughout all planes bringing with them their
