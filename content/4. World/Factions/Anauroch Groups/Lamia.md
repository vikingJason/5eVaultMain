# Lamia
## Overview
**Alignment**: Neutral Evil
#Alignment/Neutral-Evil

## Profile
The infamous flesh-eating race of lamia are rarer in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] than in more southerly deserts (such as those of Calimshan). Perhaps because flesh to eat is rare and the [[Laerti]] compete for the same diet, lamia tend to be found in the western end of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]], and in [[The Frozen Sea|the Frozen Sea]].

The largest and most powerful lamia community is in the city of [[Hlaungadath]] (described in [[III - The High Ice|The High Ice]] chapter), but they are also known to roam the desert due east of Hills Edge (where they often battle expeditions from that city and Zhentarim patrols out of Yellow Snake Pass), and to dwell at Lions Eye Oasis, the most verdant spot in the western Sword.

The lamia of Lions Eye are currently led by The Glaendra, a female lamia noble of striking height (9) and beauty. She is said to command both much wealth (in the form of rubies and emeralds looted from sand-covered ruins in the area controlled by the lamia), and a formidable arsenal of magical weapons and items, gathered over the years from Netherese tombs, abandoned towers, and storage-crypts.
