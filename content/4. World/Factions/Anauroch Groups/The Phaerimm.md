In caverns under the rich human kingdoms in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], in an area of the Underdark known as the Phaerlin, dwelt a race of ancient, fell beings who had long worked at mastering magic to defend themselves against the predators of the Realms Below. This race, known as the Phaerimm (they are fuller detailed in an entry in the Monsters of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] chapter of this book), are foul and dangerous to human eyes, but they work magic as dragons do, and in aggressiveness and intelligence are not very different from humans.

The Phaerimm thought of the area as their own realm and ignored those who dwelt on the surface (in which they had little interest). That changed when the human residents of one of those surface territories rose suddenly in magical strength, to challenge (however unwittingly) the power of the Phaerimm. Phaerimm magics were interfered with, or destroyed. Magic (in the hands of the human wizards of [[V - Netheril|Netheril]]) was used to slay encountered Phaerimm monsters as the humans began to explore, mine, and alter the underways, seeking gems and metal-ores.

They found death. The most powerful Phaerimm worked together to develop a mighty spell that would destroy the things that humans lived on: the lifedrain.

## The Lifedrain
This spell was cast, and cast again, by brave Phaerimm venturing onto the surface by night, over all the lands of men that menaced the realm of the Phaerimm. Once it was set in motion, the Phaerimm hurled themselves into a spellwar, attacking Netherese wizards, trying to steal or destroy their spellbooks, and trying above all to disrupt their researches, thin their ranks, and keep them too busy fighting to have time enough to learn the secrets of the mightiest Phaerimm spell-or to have time to act against it.

The Phaerimm prevailed. As the wellprotected Phaerimm struck magically at each Netherese wizard and every simple everyday magic practiced by the Netherese, and the realm erupted in ceaseless chaos, the drying effects of thousands of lifedrain spells spread. Castles were made uninhabitable by bold Phaerimm casting the spells within their lirallsand the folk of [[V - Netheril|Netheril]] who could not work magic were slaughtered and terrorized by the score in the magical fray. The Phaerimm did not care what happened to the surface, and lashed out with spells or laid them in waiting as traps, freely.

These unidentified spells halted the advance of lifedrain spells, and somehow confined the Phaerimm within the area they had already devastated. The Sharn took no further interest in the Phaerimm, and windswept, desolate [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] today remains the prison of this proud, terrible race.

The bewildered Netherese fought back-but they had become a decadent, refined, wealthy race of self-interested, independent individuals, with interests all over Faerun, and all too little time to spare for anything save what they chose to spend it on. The Netherese had lost the need to stand and fight together, and were given no time to regain it. As the magical onslaught continued, the desolation of the lifedrain spells continued, driving folk from their homes and farms. Dust storms lashed [[V - Netheril|Netheril]] for the first time, and displaced beasts of all sorts, from harmless scurrying things to dangerous monsters, roamed the land that was left, desperate and bewildered, quick to lash out at the disorganized humans.

The Netherese began to flee. First the common folk, with no leadership or salvation from the wizards in sight, little food and water, and the land risen against them, fled with what they could carry, south and west, to Amn, the Sword Coast, Irieabor, Cormyr, and the cities all about the Sea of Fallen Stars.

Then the mages left, deserted by those who fed them and provided for their needs, and in most cases intent on their own researches and aims over everything else. They scattered all over the known North, settling alone in a thousand remote valleys and hidden fastnesses. Large bands of them flew far to the south in the magical flying ships devised a decade earlier, to found the wizards realm of Halruaa.

The desolation continued; east of [[V - Netheril|Netheril]], a desert formed as the Narrow Sea dried up, and winds carried away the dried-out soil. This devastation was viewed with alarm by the elves of Evereska and the Elven Court, who-like the Netherese wizards before themcould find no way to check the advance of the spreading desert. After this foul magic destroyed the lands flora and fauna, and stripped it of the ability to retain water and grow new things, the winds and the harsh climate did the rest, creating the Great Sand Sea we know now.

## The Sharn Act
Fortunately for all surface life on Faerun, the Phaerimm were not the only magicallypowerful race who dwelt in the North. To the west of Phaerimm territory, across a vastness of wild Underdark, were the tunnels claimed then by the Sharn (from about Secomber to the Sword Coast, in a narrow region centered on the channel of the lower Delimbiyr, reaching about as far north as Sarcrag). A mysterious, whimsical spellcasting race, the Sharn are sometimes encountered in the great dungeon of UnderMountain today, and are detailed in their own Monstrous Compendium entry in The Ruins of UnderMountain boxed set.

Most Sharn only dabble in magic; beyond personal abilities (detailed in their monster entry), they command only what magic they can seize in the form of items, potions, and scrolls. A few Sharn, however, study magic, and these can rise to rival the most powerful human wizards in magical might.

Elminster warns that Sharn wizards avoid human contact, and should not be pursued if they are inadvertently discovered. In game terms, most range in power from about the strength of a 19th level wizard to a match for a 26th level mage, most employ magics not known to humans, and some seem able to cast two separate spells in a round! It is certain, however, that the magical efforts of certain Sharn, five hundred years ago, saved Faerun for all surface-dwellersand that the Sharn have made no move to rule or even influence what they saved since. The Sharn wizards checked the advance of the Phaerimminvoked devastation with newly devised, awesomely powerful spells of their own.

## The Phaerimm, Now
Like all caged beasts, the Phaerimm want out of their underearth prison. They are working tirelessly to overcome the Sharn spells that bind them in a certain area of the Underdark, using magically-influenced agents ([[Laerti]], Zhentarim who foolishly venture into their reach, and far worse creatures) to reach out beyond their prison. These agents seek out and bring back whatever magic they can seize, and spread rumors of rich treasure, to attract humans to [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. The Phaerimm await the prey that their agents send-waiting to devour, enslave, and interrogate, in hopes of learning ways to defeat the Sharn magic.

## Restoring Anauroch
Beings who want to destroy the desert conditions of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] will find that even the most powerful spells will not prevail against lifedrain effects until the Phaerimm are gone. Even then, expunging those deadly magics will necessitate great amounts of magical power (perhaps involving the sacrifice of mortal wizards lives, magical items and artifacts, and perhaps even divine aid).

The result will be large magic-dead areas, their effects as described in the FORGOTTEN REALMSÂ® Adventures sourcebook. They will make restoration of living things all the more slow and backbreaking: water, grasses, and all must be brought in by hand, with weather magic (to bring rains and stop soil-blowing winds) available only on the borders. Decades even centuries-of work will be needed to make the desert only a memory.

## Story
These sinister beings (detailed in the Monsters of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] chapter) are the present rulers of the Buried Realms, and the creators of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] as we know it today. Their mindcontrolling spells hold even illithids in thrall, and influence-in a subtle but all-pervasive rule-all creatures beneath [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. PCs in the Buried Realms must make Intelligence Checks at least once per turn, or fall under a Phaerimm charm or suggestion. Through controlled minds, the Phaerimm rule an entire nation of beholders who think themselves independent, dwelling in several ruined cities of the Anaurian Underdark. The beholders are mighty, employing Death Tyrants (undead beholders) and orc, hobgoblin, and xorn slaves of their own, as they mine for wealth and scheme to expand their realms southward and up to the surface world. They are, however, loosely ruled by an Elder Orb (a spellcasting beholder of great powers; its type is detailed in The Ruins of UnderMountain boxed set)and that Orb, Rilathdool, is the pawn of the Phaerimm.

So the Phaerimm rule-haughty, scheming always among themselves, but keeping behind a screen of mind-controlled slaves from mind flayers to giants, goblinkin of all sorts to humans. Ever they vie with each other for supremacy in non-violent, subtle confrontations of brinksmanship, one Phaerimm demonstrating the superiority of its strategy, forethought, and influence over that of another; and ever they seek to break the spell-bonds the Sharn have placed on them, and expand their influence over more and more of Faerun. Where the Phaerimm cannot (yet) go, their agents can reach. What agents? The Phaerimm are busily subverting the Red Wizards of Thay, any adventurers who come within reach (i.e., into [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]), and [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] who have intruded into [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], too. Even Elminster must tread warily around these titans of magic and intrigue; he can tell us little of the spells they have developed.

Phaerimm enjoy magic, and exult in wielding its unleashed power. They are fascinated by new spells and effects, and admire those who show genius in the mastery and devising of magic: such as Phaerl, The First. Phaerl perished in the War Against the Sharn, but Phaerimm still venerate his memory, and obey Phaerls one-time colleague, Ooumraun The Seeker, a ancient, huge, wrinkled Phaerimm who developed many of the Phaerimm spells (and, it is whispered, others of awesome power not yet revealed to fellow Phaerimm, with which Ooumraun has defended itself against the challenges and treacheries of ambitious Phaerimm over the years).

Although Phaerimm memorize spells much as human wizards do, they cast spells by effort of will alone, and can also adopt a single spell of each level as natural. The spell (which cannot be changed, once chosen) is retained in their brain structure. Phaerimm regain natural spells without study every day. Phaerimm are true masters of magic; some sages believe that their meddling may have created most of the magic-using monsters that menace the Realms today (including, perhaps, the beholder races!). Even the least experienced and powerful Phaerimm are capable of developing strange and terrifying new magics (providing DMs ideal opportunities for testing or introducing new spells into a campaign), and the veterans of the race know or can anticipate every nuance and side-effect of magic they observe being wielded. No elder Phaerimm will be caught unawares by a spells range, precise effects, the results of its combination with other magics, or the like; but Phaerimm may be slow to unleash magic at intruders, for fear of playing into the plans of a rival Phaerimm.

The moisture-drinking magics of the Phaerimm that created the wastes of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] hold sway over the surface, but rarely stray into the depths beneath.
