- **Preemptive Strikes:** The Dawn's Shadow gathers intelligence to identify potential threats and eliminate them before they can cause widespread damage.

Red Caps, known for their cunning and adaptability, might serve as scouts and spies. Dryads, wise and long-lived, could act as advisors and keepers of ancient knowledge. More reclusive Fey, like Satyrs and Korreds, might hold positions of leadership, using their potent magic to manipulate events when necessary.
