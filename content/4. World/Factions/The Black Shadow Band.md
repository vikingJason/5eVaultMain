# The Black Shadow Band
## Overview
**Type**: Adventuring Party
#Organization/Adventuring-Party

The Black Shadow Band: A band of adventurers based in a cave in the Tethyamar Mountains, this group is chaotic neutral in general alignment. They will make temporary alliances and non-aggression pacts, but are best described as always aggressive, always dangerous. Cold-blooded treachery is not in their nature, but a love of violence and a heedlessness for consequences is. These are true social misfits, who cant abide the rule of any law and order.

## Profile
The Black Shadows are human unless otherwise noted, and are: [[Tamaerl]] (female warrior leader); [[Jesslinn]] (female warrior); [[Barrin]] (male thief); [[Thurndas]] (male priest); [[Kyllyrd]] (halfelven male wizard); and [[Durve]] (half-elven female mage/thief). Their statistics, current alliances, and treasure are left to the DM, to tailor to best challenge PCs.

The Black Shadows have a powerful magical item (an Orcward Stone?), hidden in their cave, that seems to keep orcs away It was recovered from one of the ruins of [[Anauria]] (and its true nature is left to the DM).
