### Motto
Let nature's whispers guide our steps, lest the mortal world pay the debts.

### Beliefs
- All Whisperers with breath in their belly must answer the call to protect another creature of the Feywild
- The politics, decision-making  and everyday life of the Eladrin of Calindor must be influenced from the shadows to prevent actions that might harm the Fey
- Wealth is meaningless if the natural world is destroyed

### Goals
The Whispering Court's primary goal is to ensure the continued existence of the Feywild and its unique magic. They see Calindor, with its vulnerability to disease and war, as inherently unstable and a potential threat to the delicate balance between realms so the creatures of The Court subtly influences what happens in Calindor.

### Typical Quests


### Powers (Perks):

Moonlit Stalkers - send members on missions
Silver Tongue - gain a follower
Shadow Dancer - safe passage/lodging
Masked Face - access to information, rumours

### Features
Features are used during the Intrigue phase granting additional abiltiies of the Organization.

### Activities
Activities that organizationis involved in, both past, current and future.
The Court generally avoids direct intervention in Calindor's affairs. However, if they perceive a grave threat to the Feywild, they might resort to more drastic measures, such as sabotage, misinformation campaigns, or even unleashing minor Fey creatures to create chaos and distract Calindorians.

### History/Background 

### Membership/Requirements
The Court is comprised entirely of Fey creatures, with a hierarchy that reflects the power structures within the Feywild. Red Caps, known for their cunning and adaptability, might serve as scouts and spies. Dryads, wise and long-lived, could act as advisors and keepers of ancient knowledge. More reclusive Fey, like Satyrs and Korreds, might hold positions of leadership, using their potent magic to manipulate events when necessary.
