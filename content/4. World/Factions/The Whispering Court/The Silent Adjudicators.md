### Motto
Whispers turn to thorns, the Eladrin shall learn

### Beliefs
* The natural order has been disrupted and the true potential of the Fae hindered. 
- The Eladrin's influence is a cancerous growth that must be excised.
- No act is too extreme if it helps realise our goals

### Goals
The Silent Adjudicators ultimately aim to establish a hidden dominion where the Fae subtly control Calindor from the shadows. They envision a world where Eladrin influence is diminished, major decisions are influenced by whispers from the Feywild, and the power rests firmly in the hands of the Fae creatures. They might achieve this through:

- **Fae Supremacy:** The Eladrin are usurpers. Calindor belongs to the Fae, and we shall claim it.
- **The Unveiled Truth:** The Whispering Court has failed us. We are the true guardians of the Fae.
- **The Pruning of Thorns:** The Eladrin blight must be eradicated. Only then can Calindor flourish under Fae dominion.

### History/Background 

As part of his efforts to restore the Tower of Luminaria to its former prominence, Daehorn inssued an Edict and invited/accepted Fae creatures to study and teach at the Tower.  
  
From these Fae creatures Daehorn was excited to see Rhyvesh show great promise with his affinity and understanding of the magical weaves and took him under his wing.  
  
Rhyvesh was young, ambitious and a little chaotic, somewhat similar to Daehorn's very close friend Nox. There were a few times where Daehorn had to "remind" him of the Tower's Dictates of Study.  
  
Rhyvesh learning much from Daehorn was eventually invited to join the Council of Adjudication, impressing all with his wisdom and maturity when passing judgement on experiments being held at the Tower.  
  
While Rhyvesh's ambition was not dampened it did seem that it was better focused towards helping Calindor and was given more freedom to pursue things without as much oversight.  
  
Then suddenly the world as we knew it changed as Calindor was ripped from the Feywilds after a magical ritual went wrong. Daehorn can't help but feel responsible and can't shake the feeling that Rhyvesh was somehow responsible for the ritual going wrong but couldn't prove it.  
  
After this cataclysm Daehorn noticed a change in Rhyvesh. Rhyvesh's connection to magical weaves seemed to no longer be as harnessed or controlled, with mistakes happening frequently. He started to become hostile towards non Fae at the Tower, and would mention in times that the Eladrin were responsible for what had happened to the Fae's magic being distorted.  
  
When the plauge spread across Calindor Daehorn threw the resources of the Tower at trying to help the people of the kingdom, looking at magical ways to keep the people fed.  
  
This caused a rift between Rhyvesh and Daehorn, with the former believing that the plague was a result of the Cataclysm amd that the Tower should be focused on restoring Calindor to the realm it belonged at the sake of people now. Rhyvesh would openly question Daehorn's rules of the Tower as these were trying times and more direct measures to address them were required.  
  
Rhyvesh started to hold secret meetings with other Fae at the Tower and would adjudicate over matters that were brought to him.  
  
Mentor and pupil would get into clashes over this as there was no way Rhyvesh would see any other view point. When the Accord between Queen Reeva and the Whispering Court was announced, this was the last straw for Rhyvesh who could not see past this a major transgression against the Fae at the Fae.  
  
Daehorn expelled Rhyvesh, or Rhyvesh made the decision to leave the Tower which he saw as a weapon of Queen Reeva against the Fae. No one is sure what the truth is except Daehorn and Rhyvesh about who's decision it was, but Rhyvesh left the Tower, taking with him many of the Fae who were studying at the Tower.  
  
Trying to keep track of Rhyvesh and his group became more and more difficult and eventually it was as if they disappeared into the shadows.  
  
Hushed whispers and rumours of Rhyvesh and his silent adjudications can still be heard around the Tower.  
  
Daehorn has received reports that seem too coincidental, of pockets of Fae creatures disrupting or causing issues for the Eladrin of Calindor but has not been able to prove that it is Rhyvesh and his followers.

### Membership/Requirements
The Court is comprised entirely of Fey creatures, with a hierarchy that reflects the power structures within the Feywild. Red Caps, known for their cunning and adaptability, might serve as scouts and spies. Dryads, wise and long-lived, could act as advisors and keepers of ancient knowledge. More reclusive Fey, like Satyrs and Korreds, might hold positions of leadership, using their potent magic to manipulate events when necessary.
