# Blackhorn Alley
## Overview
The northernmost of the passages cutting through the city blocks that stand between the [[High Road]] and the Way of the Dragon, this alleyway is named for a long-dead cobbler of some note, Alsible Blackhorn, who lived on it. Today it is a constant haunt of brown rats big enough to make a (disgusting) meal of and some poor folk do just that, hunting them with clubs and hurled, empty crates.
