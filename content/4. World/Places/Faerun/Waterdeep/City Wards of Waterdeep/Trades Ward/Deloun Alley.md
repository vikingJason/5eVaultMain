# Deloun Alley
## Overview
**Type**: Area
#Adventure-Area/Area

Reached from [[Chelors Alley]], this back-of-the-shops delivery route is always crowded with crates, barrels, and the like. By night, rats of both the human and rodent sort lurk here, where crates can easily be toppled onto, or to block the escape of, surprised victims.
