# Quill Alley (Alley)
## Overview
Now a proper street, this passage is the traditional neighborhood of scribes, cartographers, and clerks. It is named for the feathers that most people of letters use as pens. You can still hire many here.

The visitor will see many exterior staircases winding up and down the sides of the rickety old buildings along this lane. Children love to play among them, and so, by night, do thieves.
