# Trades Ward
## Overview
Of all the wards in [[Waterdeep]], this ward has the least community feel. You certainly can't tell by walking through the streets where it ends and [[South Ward]] or [[Dock Ward]] begins.

Trades Ward is almost entirely given over to commerce. Middleclass workers and merchants dwell and ply their trades there. The ward wraps around most of the [[City of the Dead]], running out from its walls along Andamaars Street to the [[High Road]], down that broad street to Snail Street, and down Snail Street to Shesstra s Street, where it turns east. The boundary jogs south at Book Street to Drakiir Street, runs east along it to the Way of the Dragon, keeps to the north side of Telshambra s Street as it runs on east to the [[High Road]], and there jogs north again to turn east at Sahtyra s Lane. It takes in Caravan Court and then follows Belzors Walk northeast to the city wall. The city wall, and those of the [[City of the Dead]], make up the rest of its boundaries.

Inside this area are many landmarks the visitor wont want to miss. Besides, its almost impossible to travel anywhere in [[Waterdeep]] without passing through Trades Ward. Its streets are always busy. On dark nights, so many lighters are at work here that it looks like a sea of bobbing stars from afar.

Watch patrols are very frequent. The protection of property is paramount in this wardtheft and vandalism are the worst evils. Crowding, pushing, shoving, and cursing are commonplace at the days height.

## Points of Interest
The congested streets make walking while looking up in this wardor even stopping for a good lookhazardous at most times of day. This is quite a pity, because theres a lot to see.

The first thing that strikes ones eye is the tallest building: [[The Plinth (City Building _ Temple)|the Plinth]], a temple at which all faiths can pray. No person can be barred entry from it. In fact, in winter its warmth keeps a lot of poorer citizens alive.

This mighty tower stands like a needle-like, tall and thin pyramid with the top cut off. The flat roof is a landing place for aerial steeds used by the wealthy and powerful. At many levels on the Plinths sides are balconies. City laws forbid sacrifices of intelligent beings to any god, but a lot of folk leap or are helped to fall from these heights each year.

The next most prominent features of the ward are three open spacesthe Court of the White Bull, where livestock is bought and sold; Caravan Court, which is usually a dust-shrouded melee of cursing whip-wielding drovers, bawling beasts of burden, and creaking wagons and carts; and Virgins Square, where warriors gather to await hire.

There are plenty of inns and taverns in this ward, but aside from [[The Plinth (City Building _ Temple)|the Plinth]], no temples. There are also countless shops, most rising three floors above the street, with apartments above the storesbut only one mages tower.2 Im sure many wizards of middling powers dwell here, but theres only one of power and wealth enough to erect a traditional wizards tower who has elected to stay in Trades Ward.

The main feature of this ward are the many guildhallsa wearying list of places that vie for the attention of passersby with large replicas of whatever goods the guild produces, gilded lettering, and grand facades. These are working headquarters, and many folk travel a long way to get inside them, to deal with the guilds. The guildhalls are: the [[Citadel of the Arrow (Guild Hall)|Citadel of the Arrow]] headquarters of the Fellowship of Bowyers & Fletchers;3 Costumers Hall, of the Order of Master Taylors, Glovers, & Mercers;4 [[The House of Song (Guild Hall)|the House of Song]], of the Council of Musicians, Instrument-Makers, and Choristers; 5 the Office of the League of Basketmakers & Wickerworkers; 6 and [[The House of Cleanliness (Guild Hall)|the House of Cleanliness]], of the Launderers Guild.7

This ward is also home to the Old Guildhall, headquarters to the Cellarers and Plumbers Guild;8 [[The Zoarstar (Guild Hall)|the Zoarstar]], headquarters of the Scriveners, Scribes, and Clerks Guild;9 [[The House of Textiles (Guild Hall)|the House of Textiles]], of the Most Excellent Order of Weavers and Dyers;10 [[The Guild Paddock (Guild Hall)|the Guild Paddock]], of the Stablemasters and Farriers Guild;11 Cobblers & Corvisers House;12 [[The House of Light (Guild Hall)|the house of light]],of the Guild of Chandlers & Lamplighters;13 Stationers Ha11;14 and [[Wheel Hall (Guild Hall)|Wheel Hall]], of the Wheelwrights Guild.15

[[The Zoarstar (Guild Hall)|The Zoarstar]], in particular, is always crowded. Aside from all those who need letters written, gawkers are always peering through the windows at the maps, charts, and architectural renderings on display on easels at its front. One such map is always an overall view of the city as a kindness to visitors. Go there if you get lost. [[The Zoarstar (Guild Hall)|The Zoarstar]] is on the northwest corner of [[Quill Alley (Alley)|Quill Alley]] and Wide Way northwest of the Court of the White Bull.

Shoppers should explore at night in a leisurely manner with a lighter and a group of armed friends, then traverse the ward in an organized shopping route by day. Its often said you can buy anything in [[Waterdeep]]. A walk around Trades Ward will have you believing that. (Ill admit I let the guaranteed unicat familiar go even before its illusory unicorn horn started to fade. It stopped clawing me and hurried back to its shop to be sold again.)

**Alleys**: Trades Wards alleys are crowded, of ten highly scented passages usually crammed with garbage, delivered and stored goods, or just empty crates. They are always busy and may not offer much faster travel than the larger streets they wind among. Many a brawler has found that close quarters here prevent the use of a favorite but large weapon or can cause an inglorious collapse of boxes on top of himself!
