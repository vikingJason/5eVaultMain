# Tsarnen Alley
## Overview
Running east off the Way of the Dragon to Burdag Lane just north of [[The Plinth (City Building _ Temple)|the Plinth]], this passage and [[Lathins Cut]] provide a shortcut through the blocks of buildings. Thieves often preyed upon the traffic here in older days but Tsarnen the ranger made it his business to bodily dispose of them in a quite unpleasant manner one summer before the Thieves Guild was overthrown. (Tsarnen had had a very bad expience with muggers early in life.) The thieves moved to safer hunting grounds after a short time. These days, with Tsarnen long in his grave, the passage is not quite as safe, but watch patrols and, by day pilgrims and priests pass along it often.
