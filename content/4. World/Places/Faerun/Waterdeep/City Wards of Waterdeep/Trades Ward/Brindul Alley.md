# Brindul Alley
## Overview
This crescent-shaped alley lies between Sorn Street and River Street. It is the frequent haunt of a dangerous apparitionone more often encountered near the docks in older days, but seen here since a few winters ago: the Hand That Sings. The Hand has been seen more than once in Brindul Alley or floating in the ways nearby. It is an animated human hand with a mouth in its palm. The strange apparition all too similar to the sign of cursed Moander, the ancient and evil god who never sleeps quite soundly enough.
