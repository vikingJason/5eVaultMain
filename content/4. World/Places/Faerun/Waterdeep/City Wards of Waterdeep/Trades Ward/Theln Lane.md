# Theln Lane
## Overview
This short cut-through links Irimars Walk with Andamaars Street at the north end of Trades Ward. Its an echoing, bare passage overhung by balconies where hard currency girls dwell, lowering rope ladders to clients. Theln was a businessman who lived and died long ago in one of the buildings on this alleyway.
