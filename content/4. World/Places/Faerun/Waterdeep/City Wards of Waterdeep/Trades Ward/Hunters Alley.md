# Hunters Alley
## Overview
**Type**: Area
#Adventure-Area/Area

This narrow passage runs east from the Way of the Dragon. It continues the route of Soothsayers Way. It is named for two brave brothers who roamed the Realms when yet young. One became a lore lord of the Realms, and the other currently aspires to dukedom. As in their company, those who traverse this way generally have a wild but ultimately safe journey.
