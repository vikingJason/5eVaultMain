# Port Miir
## Overview
**Type**: Ruin
#Adventure-Area/Ruin

Port Miir was a lawless, roaring place, the center of commerce for goods entering and leaving the West Kingdoms (as they were called then). The goods came and went east out of the port on Berothir's Trail (named for the ranger who established it, slain by the orcs in doing so).

It was a city of moneylenders, caravanmasters, and quick money, where a loose band of ruling wizards struggled to keep down the numbers and successes of thieves. Oum was a crossroads-town, where roads and merchants met. It straddled the border between [[Hlondath]] and [[Asram]], belonging to neither (and at times, was a source of tense hostility and confrontation between the two kingdoms).

It became a place of bookshops, sages, and proud craft-folk, who made mirrors and glass windows (both rare in those days), fine clothing, jewelry, lamps, pottery and ironware.
