# Asram
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Other
#Geographical-Region/Other

Second richest of the Three Realms, Asram was governed from rich Phelajarama, the City of the Serpent, known for its gold-leaf-covered carved serpents, but the most important city of the realm was Orolin, the City of Magicians. In this land, magic was used in everyday things (not reserved for the ruling elite in [[V - Netheril|Netheril]]). Magicians could be hired on every street of Orolin and their wealth and works made the city a sprawling place of villas and orchards, clusteren around a circular city core with canals, parks and a fortress.

Spell-guarded expeditions went out from Orolin to secret places in the Great Sand Sea, and brought back much gold, rarer zinc, and the finest copper known in those days. If [[Anauria]] was proud, Asram was decadent. Parties went on for days, and every citizen pursued his or her own whims, trusting to the magic of the realm to defend them against foes. Jaded young nobles even invented a sport of monster-baiting, wherein they wore outlandish costumes and sought out monsters in their lairs, to flee through the night for the excitement of it all, until searching friends laid the pursuing beast low with magic.

The Asramian city of Ulshantir was noted for its coppersmiths and fine brass goods, whereas the port of Miirsar was known for its finely-crafted ships. Many small-net fishermen dwelt in Miirsar, going out in the dawn mists of Lake Miir every day to fish for the blue-scaled brench and the spicy crabfin.
