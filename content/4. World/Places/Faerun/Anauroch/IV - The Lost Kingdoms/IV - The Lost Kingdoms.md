# IV - The Lost Kingdoms
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Caverns, Underdark
#Geographical-Region/Caverns #Geographical-Region/Underdark

Many have heard of the Lost Kingdoms, those fabled, rich realms of long ago, that lie buried somewhere beneath the shifting sands of [[I - The Sword|The Sword]], in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. These lands are the source of a lot of fanciful tales, a lure for lots and lots of adventurers whod like to get rich, and a subterranean home for the sinister Phaerimm (see [[The Phaerimm]]). The Buried Realms are (correctly) said to be riddled with ancient, unmarked magical gates, allowing passageoften unintentional!-from the Realms to other planes and worlds, and vice versa. Many strange creatures appear hereabouts, and more than one famous (or infamous) being of Faerun has vanished here such as Gondegal, who stumbled between two mist-shrouded standing stones and found himself in the demiplane of Ravenloft.

Stairs, shafts, ravines, and even broad roads lead down from the Stonelands and the sands of [[I - The Sword|The Sword]] to the Lost Kingdoms below. The folk of those buried realms have become the nomadic Bedine, fearing and shunning the depths and the magic that was once theirs. More is said of those dark underlands, the Buried Realms, in the chapter entitled [[The Phaerimm]]. This chapter is a guide for DMs in placing treasures and features in the depths; here we explore the glory that was, surveying the lands that were once proud. Included in this sourcebook is a map from the Year of the Tusk (112 DR), showing these Three Realms and the beginnings of the desert created by [[The Phaerimm|the Phaerimm]], known then as the Great Sand Sea ([[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] then meant the glacier to the north, called [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]] today).

Time has stolen many of the hard facts and details of the Three Realms; here we do a whirlwind tour to catch a few ideas of what life in the Lost Kingdoms was like, then.
