# Heroes' Helm
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Hills, Other
#Geographical-Region/Hills #Geographical-Region/Other

This rock formation looks like a giant helmet.

At about midpoint in its flow, The River of Gems curls about a rocky pinnacle known as Heroes Helm because its shape and pair of eyehole-like caverns makes it resemble a gigantic warriors helm.

The two eye-tunnels lead into a lofty central cavern, home to Ghondalaath, a blue dragon of awesome size and powers, a great wyrm that commands unusual and mighty spells. The Helm rises four hundred feet above the plain; the river gorge at this point is about another hundred feet deep. Ghondalaaths cavern is about 300 feet up the Helm and is known to have traps awaiting intruders.
