# II - The Plain of Standing Stones
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Mountains, Hills, Plains
#Geographical-Region/Mountains #Geographical-Region/Hills #Geographical-Region/Plains

The middling region of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] begins where the sands of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] give way to bare rock, and rises in a plateau-a plateau broken by so many rifts, and sculpted into so many spires and fantastic crags that its name of plain is a bitter travelers joke.

The Plain is considered to end where the ice begins: the icy cliffs that are the southernmost edge of the massive glacial ice sheets that make up [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]].

This wind-lashed, cold, rocky region is known for its mineral wealth and many monsters, Comparatively few folk know that it also holds hidden valleys, many of which have water, rich meadows, and even support large wild herds of crag sheep. The outlaws, dwarven bands, human and hobgoblin barbarian tribes, and ogre, hill giant, and verbeeg groups who dwell here dont welcome intruders except as food or victims.

The Plain is bordered on the west by [[The Frozen Sea|the Frozen Sea]] (discussed in the chapter on [[III - The High Ice|The High Ice]] in this book), which runs down the Desertsedge as far as the northern Lonely Moor. On the eastern side of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], there is no real boundary between it and the Tortured Land-except that the latter holds far more moisture, and with it both wind-sculpted ice and many more plants. Where the plants end and bare rock begins, going west, travelers consider [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] to have begun. Few stay long enough to map or even get a good look at the border area; it is a cold and savage wilderness of marauding monsters.

## Story
This tiny, isolated oasis is little more than a small pool, a few palms and scrub bushes, and the bones of those who made it here too late, and were too weak to carry on before the sun killed them. Jackals and vultures are the most frequent inhabitants of this little hollow. There are persistent Bedine rumors of buried treasure here, but some elders say that those tales are misremembered: the sands around Yliyl really hide many, many graves, of a long-ago Bedine tribe who all died of some disease, and were buried with their belongings (gems, coins, and all) to prevent any spread of infection.

The howling, almost ceaseless winds have shaped and torn the rock of The Plain into spikes, pillars, and strange wave-like shapes, making it here into a tossed sea and there into a barbed forest of frozen, endless stone.

At first glance, all appears lifeless, but closer inspection reveals a few shrubs and stunted trees clinging to rock cracks and deep ravines. Those who can fly will see far more greenery than those who must struggle on foot among the rocks: they can look down on pockets of growth in ravines, guflies, and cragtop basins.

The entire region is rich in minerals, and has lured many greedy prospectors to their doom. The dwarves of the North call it Turlaghh, The Field of Broken Dreams, for this reason. No accurate maps of the Plain exist; DMs should add whatever features they wish (except human settlements) to the map. The whole area is a succession of spires, spiny ridges, cliffs and rocksfide rubble.

The larger valleys are splendors of lush grass and vivid flowers, providing forage for large herds of wild crag sheep. These in turn provide milk, wool, and meat for outlaws, renegade dwarven bands, and a few human and hobgoblin barbarian tribes. Handfuls of ogres, hill giants, and verbeeg also dwell in caves here.

## Resources
The mineral wealth of this tortured land is great, but it boasts no rich ruins or treasurecaches; there were few settlements here even before [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] was a desert. Its ravines, pools, and rock pillars or peaks seem endless in numbers, but only a few have been named by outlanders. These few are described here; DMs are reminded that near a named feature there may be dozens more anonymous features very much like it.
