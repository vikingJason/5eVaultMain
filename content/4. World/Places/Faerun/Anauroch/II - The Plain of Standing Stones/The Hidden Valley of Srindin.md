# The Hidden Valley of Srindin
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Valley
#Geographical-Region/Valley

Named for the elven explorer and adventurer who made it his home when he grew too old and gentle to roam the Realms with weapons to hand any longer, this tranquil spot is a hemispherical hidden vale, roughly two miles across. It is a picturesque combination of alpine forest and grassy meadows, watered by at least three streams that spring from its walls and rush down to the trees in everchattering cascades. The three streams come together in a deep, well-like sinkhole in the center of the vale, and there can be found the two most distinctive features of the vale: Srindins abandoned home, and a circle of corpses.

Both the homea curve-walled, beautiful, miniature castle carved from a single great piece of stone-and the corpses are floating upright in midair, above the dark waters of the pool. Some fell magic, or magic-using being, is present in the castle, which is said to still hold the relics and treasures amassed by Srindin during his adventuring career. The corpses are all skeletal, once-human, and clad in the rusting, disintegrating remnants of plate armor. They face each other in a circle perhaps thirty feet across. Bones and weapons that fall from them do not plunge into the water below, but sink only a few inches, and then hang in midair around the figures. Some unknown and very powerful magic holds them aloft: a magic that is demonstrably resistant to dispel magic.
