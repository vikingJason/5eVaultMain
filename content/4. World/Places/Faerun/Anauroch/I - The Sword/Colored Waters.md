# Colored Waters
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This large, spectacular oasis fills a bowlshaped, steep-walled ebony basin ten miles long, eight miles wide, and over a thousand feet deep. It lies in a region of small, yellow, transverse dunes, where the sand is only a few inches deep in [[The Wide (Open Marketplace)|the wide]] troughs between them. As one travels through these golden sands, the land slowly rises, until one reaches the ancient volcanic cauldron wherein Colored Waters lies.

Except for a few star dunes of golden sand, the basin is covered with fine, sable-colored silt. In its center is an amber-hued cone of cinders, nearly as tall as the basins rim. [[The Bedine]] believe this was the site of the battle where the gods destroyed Nasrs servants from the Camp of the Dead, and that the amber cone is the heaped ashes of those servants Five lakes, each shaped like a scimitars crescentiform blade, ring the base of the cone. The waters of each are a different hue: emeraldgreen, turquoise, silver, sapphire blue, and ruby-red. Bedine legend says the different colors resulted when gods fell in that long-ago battle, and their dried blood was washed or blown into the water, and dissolved.

Around each lake are wild fig trees, tall golden grasses, and leafy green bushes. Over the entire basin floor, salt-brush and hardy limegreen qassis plants poke through the ebony ash. The shape and dark hue of the basin makes it a gigantic trap for the suns heat; heat shimmer distorts vision above and in the basin, Colored Waters is warmed by volcanic activity from beneath, too: Bedine have brewed tea here simply by setting their pots on steaming rock-fissures. Colored Waters is the favored camp of the Mahwa tribe, under Sheikh Saar.
