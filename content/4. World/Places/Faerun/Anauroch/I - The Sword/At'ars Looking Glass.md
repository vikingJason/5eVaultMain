# At'ars Looking Glass
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Hills, Canyon
#Geographical-Region/Hills #Geographical-Region/Canyon

This distinctive feature of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]] is a roughly oval sea of burnished stones. It covers an area of about a hundred and forty miles (four and a half days of camel travel), east to west, and about two hundred miles north to south. Its western edge is marked by a line of obelisklike mountain peaks, known as [[The Scimitar Spires|the Scimitar Spires]] (see below). Low, dun-colored dunes line the rest of its borders.

Atars Looking Glass is a flat, seemingly endless mosaic of coin-sized stones. The pebbles are mostly red, varying in hue from blond to dark brown. All are polished glass-smooth, giving these open flats a fiery, pebbled appearance. It captures the suns heat, and is too hot for even camels to walk on for long without making them limp. A fallen Bedine, or a roast of meat, will literally cook on the stones if left motionless in the sun long enough. There is no shade or water in the Looking Glass, and no known treasure, though there are persistent Bedine tables of gemstones scattered among all the other pebbles, polished and free for the taking to those who search diligently enough.
