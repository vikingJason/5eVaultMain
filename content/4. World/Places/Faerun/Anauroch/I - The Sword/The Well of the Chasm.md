# The Well of the Chasm
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This oasis is habitually used by the Razhadi tribe. They are of the few Bedine who know where to find the Chasm, a canyon hidden in [[The Scimitar Spires|the Scimitar Spires]] mountain range (see above). Lions make this oasis their home, hunting in the surrounding hills. Bedine arriving here to camp always send in a hunting-party to slay or drive out the lions first, and post doubled guards armed with spears as well as bows and their personal swords, all the time they are encamped. Yliyl The chasm entrance, marked by a distinctive nearby wishbone-shaped spire is only 9 wide. and is known as the Mouth of the Abyss.

From the Mouth, a narrow, winding canyon descends to the Well of the Chasm. Its steeplydescending chute is often barely ten feet wide, but on occasion widens to eighty feet or more, before narrowing and bending again; a place few can defend against many. Over a distance of several miles, the canyon descends some five hundred feet below the desert, between walls marked by ledges, shelves, and sand-slides, ending in a boulderstrewn hollow: the Chasm. In the center of this small, sand-floored valley, a deep pit in the bedrock reaches an underground stream of rust-colored water.
