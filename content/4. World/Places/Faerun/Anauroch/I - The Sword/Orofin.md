# Orofin
## Overview
**Type**: Ruin
#Adventure-Area/Ruin

Orofin lies in a broad, grassy valley, overlooked by ridges. Once it was a mighty city, Orolin (for more on its glorious past, refer to The Lost Kingdoms chapter). Now, it is just several acres of ruined buildings, with a crumbling fortress at its center. Signs of its lost splendor can still be seen: four canals radiate outwards from the fortress, dividing the city into quarters.

The canals are lined with thick greenbriar hedges, interspersed with acacia and wild apricot trees. These wild tangles were once lush strips of parkland, and more recently home to lions and other desert predators (before a Bedine tribe slew them, and took the city for their own). [[The Bedine]] were slain in their turn, by a Zhentarim army that made its last stand here and fell before the angry Bedine (as described in the novel The Parched Sea). [[The Zhentarim]] did manage to poison the stagnant canalwaters, in an effort to deprive their besiegers of water; that taint (which was partially caused by the bodies of slain Bedine, and partially by mag ic) remains, making this onetime oasis a deadly wateringplace except for the still-pure deep well of the central fortress.

Wind-blown sand covers the foundations of long-fallen buildings at the outer edges of the ruined city; crooked lines in the sand mark where alleys and avenues once ran. The edge of the city is marked by a circular canal, that connects the four radiating canals together. A grand avenue encircles this canal, and from it four magnificent two-tier bridges leap the canals, to plunge into the center of each quarter of the city.

Each bridge is of granite, its mosaic-adorned pediments lifting two levels of roadway, each in three horseshoe-shaped arches, across the water. Every arch is crowned by a shallow point, and the central arch of each tier is decorated with a diamond-shaped mosaic. Of old, the underside of each bridge contained pumps that took water from the canals out into the surrounding fields; but the pumps are long silent, and the fields are beginning to expire into desert. Sand and bunch grasses can be seen here and there among the field grass. The central fortress still looks magnificent, but eleven gaps now pierce its crenellated rampart-walls. Most of the buildings that lined the insides of those walls-stables, barracks, and armories-have collapsed into the inner courtyard. This courtyard, about fifty yards across, holds a raised dais at its center, where a deep, high-pressure artesian well bubbles to the surface in a still-impressive fountain. The water empties through a small spout at the midpoint of each side of the fountains square basin, into four ducts covered by rusty steel gratings. These ducts run to the inside edges of the walls, to form four shallow wateringpools (for long-vanished cavalry horses). Each pool has a spout at its bottom, that feeds one of the four radiating canals outside the fort. Beside each pool is a staircase up to the fortress ramparts.

There is an ancient escape tunnel from the fortress to the desert outside the city. Bedine lore holds that great treasure, perhaps the largest wealth in all the world, lies hidden somewhere in this ruined city-but so far, beyond a few gold coins, dusty gems, and ancient, cracked ivory inlays, no one has found any of it. In recent times, tales of ghouls haunting the ruins have spread across [[I - The Sword|the Sword]]; few Bedine feel the urge to go and see the truth about ruined Orofin for themselves.
