# The Quarter of Emptiness
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Other
#Geographical-Region/Other

In the center of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]] is a region known as the Quarter of Emptiness, for its lack of food and water. It is simply mile upon stretching mile of bare crescent dunes, with bedrock exposed by the winds here and there between. Bedine seldom enter it; there is nothing to go in for, and it is expected that fools who do venture in will die of thirst, at about the same time as their camels starve.

In the heart of this region is an abandoned but intact ancient city, called [[Rasilith]] by Bedine elders (see below).
