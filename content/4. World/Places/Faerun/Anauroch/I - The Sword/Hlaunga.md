## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This is a verdant oasis of date palms and fruit trees, recently created by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] (see Created Oases, earlier in this chapter). A tree-cloaked hill at its center hides a stonelined well chamber. The well chamber is said to be guarded by a watchghost (detailed in the Ruins of Under- Mountain boxed set), and the main oasis pool outside watched over by a dozen skeletons who lie waiting in the water until an intelligent being tries to drink without muttering the proper password.

A water-bucket by the well and a forgotten blanket hung over a tree-branch by the pool are said to bear spell-traps that polymorph unfortunates (who touch them without giving another password) into frogs! More skeletal undead, the whispers run, lurk high up in the palms, waiting to hurl themselves upon intruders and bear them to the ground far below.
