# El Rahalat
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Mountains
#Geographical-Region/Mountains

This gray-crowned mountain is referred to as the Shunned Mountain because of Rahalat, its resident goddess. In mortal life, Rahalat was a shunned woman (Bedine sorceress), abandoned here by her tribe. She claimed the oasis at the base of the mountain as her home, and used her magic to prevent any tribe from grazing here. During a drought, the Dakawa tribe murdered her to gain use of the oasis, Legend holds that its spring turned to blood, and for the next ten years, anything that drank from it perished. Now, every Bedine tribe that camps at Rahalat must sacrifice a camel to the goddess or the water goes bad (turns to Type J poison, for all drinkers except beings favored by the goddess).

Rahalats herd of goats still lives high on the mountain slopes. The goddess warns away beings who approach them too closely with the hollow knell of goat bells ringing in the minds of those she is warning, not in their ears. When she desires, Rahalat appears directly to living beings at the oasis or on the mountain (see The Gods of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]).
