# Bhaerlith
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

**Geographical Râ€¦**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

A rich oasis of date palms and fruit trees, recently created by [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] (see Created Oases, earlier in this chapter). There is said to be a stone-lined underground storehouse and sleeping-chamber here.

Bhaerlith is also said to be haunted by a guardian daemon, who will attack any not bearing (or drawing) a certain symbol, who try to approach the central oasis pool or the entrances to the underground areas. The oasis also sports many spring-sword traps, buried in the sand around its perimeter (Zhents know the safe places to enter, by using trees within as landmarks).

Triggering one of these by an unlucky step causes the blade to burst forth from the sands, doing its maximum normal damage, and striking at THAC0 6. The bodies of Bedine and other trespassers are impaled on wooden stakes outside the oasis as warnings; several Bedine trying to steal these long, sturdy wooden poles (something rare in the desert) found out the hard way that these grisly markers are themselves trapped by fell magic and by spring-swords.
