# Vliyl
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This tiny, isolated oasis is little more than a small pool, a few palms and scrub bushes, and the bones of those who made it here too late, and were too weak to carry on before the sun killed them. Jackals and vultures are the most frequent inhabitants of this little hollow. There are persistent Bedine rumors of buried treasure here, but some elders say that those tales are misremembered: the sands around Yliyl really hide many, many graves, of a long-ago Bedine tribe who all died of some disease, and were buried with their belongings (gems, coins, and all) to prevent any spread of infection.
