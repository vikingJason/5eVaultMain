# The Saiyaddar
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Plains
#Geographical-Region/Plains

These are the prized Hunting-Lands of [[The Bedine|the Bedine]], not mentioned to outlanders, and by common agreement not the territory of any one Bedine tribe. These high, rolling grasslands are home to many gazelle, onagers, and a few lions that prey on them. The Saiyaddar stretches east and west for almost a hundred miles, between a mountain range and the ruins of [[Orofin]] (see above). It is only about half as large north to south, but is the finest gazelle country in all [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. Here and there in its depths, all the trees and plants of plenty that can withstand a hot environment grow, and many springs rise throughout the region, to keep its grass lush and tall. (Bedine who travel afoot here risk attack from snakes, who grow large and fat on a diet of many hares and birds.) Around the edges of the Saiyaddar, heaths of saltbrush crown the sand ridges.
