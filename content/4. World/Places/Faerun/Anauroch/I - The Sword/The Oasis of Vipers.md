# The Oasis of Vipers
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

This ancient, well-watered oasis near the northern edge of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]] is seldom visited by wandering Bedine, because of its ongoing infestation of extremely poisonous snakes. The bones of camels and the skulls of humans lie entangled together in the thick, ungrazed underbrush of puncture vines; ocotillos, boojum trees, and dwarf cacti. More vines enshroud the stunted acacia and leaning palm and tamarisk trees alike in a webwork of shady concealment that is the slithering home of hundreds of serpents. Birds, lizards, and small desert rodents are all absent here; any who da arrive are quickly eaten by the snakes, who prey on each other, on low-flying desert bats and on anything else unwary or desperate enough to venture towards the three small pools of the oasis.
