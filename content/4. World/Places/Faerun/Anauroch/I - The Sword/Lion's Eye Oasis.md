# Lion's Eye Oasis
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Oasis
#Geographical-Region/Oasis

The most verdant spot in the western Sword, this large oasis is home to a community of several hundred [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]], currently ruled by The Glaendra. The western edge of the oasis consists of dunes topped by mesquite trees, which fall away into a forest of acacias and date palms. This belt of trees (which dwindles, as one heads for the sands, into saltbrush and then chenopods) forms the southern boundary of the oasis, running east to a long, bare rock ridge whose highest point is pierced through. The wind whistles and moans constantly through this hole in the rock, which is the Lion s Eye itself.

The Lions Eye runs north to join a higher, level-topped ridge that forms the northern wall of the oasis. All along the inside flank of this ridge runs a high meadow, a rolling, flowered-speckled stretch of lush grass, the playground of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]]. (From time to time, the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] hide in rocks when outlanders approach, waiting for the ignorant intruders to lead their camels up to this rich grazing-land whereupon it really becomes the playground of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]]!)

This meadow slopes down to meet the palm forest, along a long, narrow lake that lies at the center of the oasis. There the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] hide their gold and gems in sunken chests that can be drawn up by ropes tied to the roots of certain palms. Old Bedine tales of a time before the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Races/Homebrew/Lamia|lamia]] came also speak of treasure in the depths of the lakelost, ancient magical treasures, guarded by horrific water-monsters.
