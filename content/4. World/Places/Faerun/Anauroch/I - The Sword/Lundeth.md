## Overview
**Community Size**: Village
#Community-Size/Village

This village of sun-fire clay huts climbs the steep sides of a rock pinnacle within a days ride of the southwestern edge of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]]. Surrounded by salt flats, and boasting its own deep well, it is a formidable, easilydefended stronghold. Using magic, [[The Zhentarim|the Zhentarim]] seized it to serve as their western base of operations. Almost twenty minor magelings and underpriests of the Brotherhood currently inhabit Lundeth, served by the undead remains of the Goldor, [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] tribe who formerly owned and held the village.
