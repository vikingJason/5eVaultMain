# Alagh's Pass
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Canyon
#Geographical-Region/Canyon

Named for a lone Bedine warrior who fell here long ago, heroically holding the pass against a rival tribe to allow his own tribe more time to flee, this barren mountain pass allows passage between the Saiyaddar (see below), on one side of the mountains, and the Hills of Scent (see below) on the other. On either side, the pass is entered through winding, rocky canyons whose cliffs are broken by many sidefissures- most of them ideal for ambushes.

Just below the pass, on the Hills of Scent side, is a nameless mamalahah (dried-up lake) no more than two miles across, its onetime floor now a patchwork of hard-baked alabaster pentagons. At its center is a muddy pond surrounded by acacia trees, that a Zhentarim army poisoned when fighting [[The Bedine|the Bedine]].
