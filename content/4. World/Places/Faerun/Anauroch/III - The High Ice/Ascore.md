# Ascore
## Overview
**Type**: Dungeon, Installation, Ruin
#Adventure-Area/Dungeon #Adventure-Area/Installation #Adventure-Area/Ruin

In FR5/The Savage Frontier; mention is made of evil-haunted Ascore, once a port (of the dwarven nation of Delzoun, itself little more than a memory) on this now-vanished sea. The half-buried hulks of colossal dwarven stone ships rise out of the sands east of Ascores abandoned docks.

Even orcs avoid the ruined city. Intrepid adventurers report that hags command legions of undead there. A circle of thirteen tall, fivesided red pyramids rises in Ascores center, and seems to be used in covey spells of great power and in rituals of worship to some evil deity-or, some whisper, a vast evil creature that lairs under the city . . .
