# Untrivvin
## Overview
**Type**: Cavern, Dungeon, Other
#Adventure-Area/Cavern #Adventure-Area/Dungeon #Adventure-Area/Other

This lonely peak is the abode of many yeti, and is said to be haunted. Its name means singing rock in a long-vanished tongue, and the name and the haunted reputation both stem from the fact that this mountain rings like a bell from time to time from the blows of hammers in the depths: hammers wielded by thaalud, or tomb tappers (detailed in the Monsters of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] chapter).

Tomb tappers dwell in the depths beneath [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]], and deeper underground elsewhere in the Realms. This mountain is the only known surface connection with their deep tunnels; it rings because it is honeycombed with smooth-carved, curving chambers and passages. Some sages say there is much treasure to be found in Untrivvin, of gems and rare metals; others say cynically that no explorer has returned laden with such-or, as far as they know, returned at all.
