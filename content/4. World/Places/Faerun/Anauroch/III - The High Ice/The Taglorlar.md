# The Taglorlar
## Overview
**Geographical Region**: Mountains, Hills
#Geographical-Region/Mountains #Geographical-Region/Hills

All over [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]], rock spurs and the pressures of shifting ice throw up little pinnacles, or wave-shaped frozen heights. These prominences provide handy lookout-points to see from (and be seen on) for desert-dwellers and visitors alike. Most are claimed as lairs or at least habitual perches by snow owls, great soarers, and other flying creatures, and may serve as windbreaks (or be hollowed out into small caves) for others.

One group of these pinnacles is named, and serve as a road of landmarks for outsiders trying to reach [[The Rift of Stars|the Rift of Stars]] (see above). The Taglorlar, or Beth of Taglo, are a line of sharp rock tors that rise out of [[II - The Plain of Standing Stones|the Plain of Standing Stones]] below the ice-line, and run steadily northeast for many days of travel. No one is known to have counted all the Teeth, but many beings have used them as a road across the ice, or as homes. Travelers planning to follow the line of peaks are warned that predators there are expecting them-and waiting hungrily.
