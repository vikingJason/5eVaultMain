### The Zhentarim in Tyranny of Dragons
Black Network agents are useful NPC's that you can introduce at appropriate times during the adventure. Characters who played Hoard o f the Dragon Queen have already met one member of the Black Network—the female gnome Jamna Gleamsilver. If the characters need information or gear they can’t obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it. A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.

Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult’s plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult’s victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters’ plans at the worst possible moment.

The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you’re fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don’t mind. Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It’s plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerun, they won’t know the full extent of the Zhentarim’s operations and goals.

Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network’s blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerun. The order’s criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves’ guild in the Western Heartlands and along The Sword Coast. Wherever a city’s coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-andcoming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it’s a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.

However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see Tiamat ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen’s return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts. This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters’ possible allies.

Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords’ Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim’s network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored. Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim’s own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great.

This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords’ Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network’s price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions— and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim’s allegiance outright in the follow-up to episode 7. In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it w ill cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.

### The Zhentarim in Anauroch
The most violent, persistent, and numerous group of outlanders active in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] today are the Zhentarim: the evil cabal of wizards and priests who have long ruled Zhentil Keep, and have spread their influence and rule over much of the North. The strength of the Zhentarim is their magic, but one cant eat a spell, or use it (often) to buy things. The wealth of the Zhentarim comes from the caravan-trade they control, carrying valuable goods of all kinds (including stolen goods, slaves, and other illegal, high-priced wares) from place to place.

The Zhentarim merchant reputation is built on their no-questions-asked practices of handling goods (even kidnap victims or stolen temple gold), of using magic and strong armored forces to guard their caravans, and always getting cargo through regardless of the perils of the road. The Black Robes try to get goods where theyre going faster than everyone else, and to do this, they have set about sabotaging competitors (an ongoing campaign of local vandalism, murder, and arson spread all over the Realms) and establishing strategic traderoutes under their own control.

The major route planned by the Zhentarim links the Moonsea (from the city of Zhentil Keep) with the Sword Coast, running just south of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. The map on page 30 shows the ways in which Zhent goods move, and future Zhentarim plans for caravan travel. Through the years, these plans have involved the Zhentarim in battles with Hillsfar (to control Yulash and to lessen Hillsfars importance as a rival trade-center), and with orcs and brigands throughout the North. There have also been skirmishes with Cormyr (who annexed Tilverton to avoid having Zhentil Keep openly seize it), [[Shadowdale]] (which continues to resist Zhent efforts to conquer it, thanks to Elminster, Storm Silverhand and other Harpers, and The Knights of Myth Drannor), and Daggerdale. Local folk in the Corm Orp area, Hills Edge, Llorkh, Loudwater, and the Dragonspear Castle area are also experienced Zhent-fighters.

The Zhentarim continue to be enriched by trade with the drow (whose tunnels come to the surface near [[Shadowdale]]; only Thay and certain folk in decadent Mulhorand seem willing to compete with the Zhents in trading openly with the dark elves), but must spend a lot of money to maintain their present route, thanks to the aggressions of goblinkin and human brigands in the Stonelands, Cormyrean patrols, and the resistance of locals all along the chosen way. Darkhold, for instance (detailed in the Castles boxed game accessory), exists entirely to protect the trade route; there are many smaller cave strongholds protecting Yellow Snake Pass, that collectively cost more than Darkhold does to staff and provision.

To pile up gold pieces in numbers they love and foresee, over the long run, the Zhentarim need to establish a secure route that is shorter and safer than the present one: one that is less vulnerable to the whims and aggressions of strong nearby realms like Cormyr. Zhent agents work tirelessly to foment unrest in Sembia, Cormyr, the Dales, Hills Edge, Iriaebor, and strategic Sword Coast communities, both to keep these places busy with their own troubles (and therefore unable to spare the time or arms to menace passing Zhent caravans), and to keep the present route profitable. This is not enough, according to the Zhentarim leaders: a shorter route must be found. That means crossing [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]].

The Zhentarim have been trying to do just that for more than twenty winters now, with (so far) decidedly limited success. They havent stopped trying, however, and a player character who ventures into [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] today will almost certainly encounter Zhentarim agents, and (hostile to everyone else) Zhentarim activity. The Zhentarim face the same harsh, forbidding conditions in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] that have stopped everyone else from using it as a fast traveling route before the Zhents came along. At first, the Zhentarim assumed that they could neutralize these perils with magic or use magic to avoid them, by flying over the desert, or digging a route underneath it.

They failed. Both the skies above [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] and the depths beneath its sands are home to magic so strong and complex that the Zhentarim have not yet managed to overcome it (and may never do so). The reasons for this can he found in the chapters on The Phaerirnm and The Secret of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]. These magics continue to thwart Zhent agents, and in some cases subvert the minds of agents to make them unwittingly work against Zhent plans. The only part of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] useful for a shorter trade route is [[I - The Sword|the Sword]]. The Stonelands, [[II - The Plain of Standing Stones|the Plain of Standing Stones]], and [[III - The High Ice|the High Ice]] are all broken terrain, full of barriersand with hostile aerial creatures ready to disrupt any regular trade that tries to fly over the natural barriers.

The Zhentarim tried establishing bases in the hidden valleys of the Plain, and flying caravans across. Each and every trip, once their attempts became regular, was imperilled by a gauntlet of wyverns and dragons that actually lined up in midair to await the intruders. Blasting a way through the skies with spells proved too costly in wizards (the Zhentarim are hated throughout the North; to survive at all, they need many healthy wizards active on the ground) for the Zhents to continue it-and a few forays over the Stonelands brought forth both an aerial Cormyrean cavalry, and a number of independent menaces (including flying Harpers, and dracoliches from the Thunder Peaks, alerted by the rival Cult of the Dragon) to endanger the air-way.

So, summing up the costs in magic, personnel, and supplies of all these longer detours by air or over the more northerly parts of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], the Zhents were left with only one choice for their route: the blazing sands of [[I - The Sword|the Sword]]. Crossing [[I - The Sword|the Sword]] means dealing with the treacherous Dtarig (if theres to be any trade across [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], the Dtarig aim to control it and grow fat on it) and the fierce Bedine.

The Dtarig are foolish, disorganized, and selfish enough that the Zhentarim can treat them as they did the folk of Melvaunt, Phlan, and other rivals in the Dragonreach lands. They used magic to spy out Dtarig individuals and communities, hired certain Dtarig as their agents, and killed or impoverished (by vandalism, arranged misfortunes, and the like) certain others, to effectively persuade the Dtarig into leaving them alone or helping them. (The Dtarig themselves are detailed in the chapter on Other Peoples of Anauroch.) [[The Bedine]], used to fighting each other and almost everything else they encounter, present a tougher obstacle to overcome. Very few of them can be bought, and none of them can be intimidated by threats or magic; the use of hostile magic by an outlander makes them determined to destroy that being, not to surrender or obey him.

The Zhentarim tried their usual bullying methods, and sending strike teams of powerful wizards heavily protected by magical items to slay key Bedine leaders; but these had little lasting effect (the new sheikhs were of the same essential nature as the slain ones, [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] will not tolerate an outsider as a sheikh, and [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] tribes are too small to fool anyone with magic, to install a Zhentarim agent as a sheikh in the magical guise of a Bedine), and even attracted the attention of Harpers, Dragon Cultists, independent meddlers such as The Simbul of Aglarond and Elminster. Some of these acted directly against the Zhents, or sent agents to work against them. The Zhents then adopted a new, twopronged strategy (anticipated by Harpers such as Lander of Sembia). This consisted of a velvet-gloved hand of friendship-and a strong, treacherous sword of force.

The Black Robes approach a Bedine sheikh, offer him a friendly trade-treaty (with bribes of steel, rare and valuable in the desert, used for making the best weapons, and gems), and find a pretext to invite the sheikhs family or other important members of the tribe into extheir camp. Then they hold these guests, controlled by magic, to guarantee the tribes submission.

Zhentarim agents are then installed to watch over the tribe. Magelings with enough magic to spy for signs of rebellion, and to crush it or call in magic-powerful reinforcements. At the same time, the Black Robes begin to enrich the tribe, introducing gold coins, gems, wine and rich food. The most troublesome tribesmen are plied with drink to keep them docile. Should their fighting fure be needed, there are other means to rouse them. By magic, the Zhentarim learn of any famous or respected elders of the tribe who have died, and use their magic again to send images of these dead by night to speak to the tribesmen and convince them that it is right to follow the way of the Black Robes. When the tribe is loyal to them, the Zhentarim move on to the next one.

At the same time, the Zhentarim hire armies of over three thousand man-eating desert dwelling [[Laerti]] and promise them protection by day against Bedine. This protection is provided by several hundred Zhentilar warriors, priests and wizards.

If diplomacy fails or falters, the army is used to subde a dozen tribes, and then hostages, bribery, and violence to enslave the others. The controlled tribes are used to overpower the others, the [[Laerti|laerti]] are allowed to feed freely on Bedine so long as the leave the Zhent caravans alone and the Zhentilar army leaves the desert, its task done.

Some of these Zhentarim agents use rings of invisibility and blinking, and (a Zhentarim specialty) rings that allow them dimension door. They always have magic enough to overwhelm and capture individual Bedine, and to interrogate them, and they have coins and metal enough to buy what loyalty they can. A few (such as the wizard Yhekal, who is at least a W9, and has skin and hair as pale as white sand, flashing blue eyes, and wears a hooded purple robe and silver wrist-bracers) are powerful or influential enough to have clones or other magical means of resurrecting themselves, should they be slain in the desert.

The Black Robes have offered Dtarig and some Bedine five hundred gold pieces per head for identifying Harpers to them (telling the desert folk that the Harpers are a tribe of meddling fools who stand in the path of free commerce and the growth of kingdoms). They know that Those Who Harp will be their chief foes in their attempt to set up a trade route across [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]].

This tendency of Zhent commanders to get things done with a minimum of risk and bother to the main organization by letting (or forcing) underlings to prove themselves by doing difficult things in any unsupervised, sloppy, and reckless manner they want to, just to get the job done, allows DMs to freely tailor Zhent forces to challenge PCs. A Zhentarim band can be a dozen warriors led by a W4 or W6, or anything up to an army of several hundred under a dozen wizards, each of up to 12th level. DMs are also free to have Zhentarim acting personally against PCs in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], in running fights, without any efficient organization that alerts one group of Zhents when the PCs are fighting with another (necessarily, if the PCs are too weak to survive). Zhentarim can be of any rank or influence the DM wishes; not even Elminster knows what ambitious mages, wizards, priests of Bane, Cyric or the other evil gods, thieves, and warriors have joined the Zhentarim recently.

Please refer to [[I - The Sword|The Sword]] chapter for details of Zhentarim bases established in the desert (including an ingenious practice of growing an oasis around a decanter of endless water). At least five such bases are known to exist in the desert: [[Bhaerlith]], [[Hlaunga]], Maatar, [[Olomaa]], and [[Vuerthyl]]. The Zhentarim can rely on supplies and reinforcements from a Zhentilar encampment in Arntethyl, the high alpine valley where the River Tesh is formed, and spills out of the mountains (down gorges to the valley of the Tesh, where the main Zhentilar and mercenary encampments are located, around the ruins of Teshwave) and from Darkhold (in emergencies only; the man who calls for these when they are not needed will pay with his head-after suitable torments have been visited upon him). At least a thousand warriors are in Arntethyl, and at least twenty Zhentarim magelings (W3s to W9s). They are under the command of the wizard Ruatheene, Manshoon s latest favorite. She is only a W6, but maintains order with the help of a beholder of awesome size and powers, Araunglauth, whose abode Arntethyl has been for almost seventy years. Ruatheene will not enter [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]], whatever happens-but she will unleash the eager magelings under her, if the Zhentarim suffer reverses in the desert. They include Mhaumask of Mordulkin (LE hm W9); Ologhyn of Voonlar (NE hm W7; known for his collection of rare and strange wands); Hlartenth of Procampur (LE hm W8, a wizard under a curse that changes him from male to female,
