# Kozah (Talos)
## Overview
Kozah is [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] god of tempests; he vents his wrath by causing sandstorms (the sand left in the air for days after a major storm, that colors the sky crimson as the sun rises, is known as Kozahs mark). Desert storms show his fury at the faithlessness of his wife Atar, as the harlot enters Nasrs tent night after night ( = the sun goes down). Kozah is the god Talos; priesthood details are given in the FORGOTTEN REALMS Adventures sourcebook. Clergy of Tales who enter [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] will be tolerated but not obeyed.

Same deity as Talos.
