# Barthen's Provisions
## Overview
Barthen's is the biggest trading post in [[Phandalin]] . Its shelves stock most ordinary goods and supplies, including backpacks, bed rolls, rope, and rations. The place is open from sunup to sundown. Barthen's does not stock weapons or armor, but characters can purchase other adventuring gear here, with the exception of items that cost more than 25 gp. (For prices, see "Adventuring Gear" in the rulebook.) Characters in need of weapons or armor are directed to the Lionshield Coster.

The proprietor is [[Elmar Barthen]], a lean and balding human male shopkeeper of fifty years with a kindly manner. He employs a couple young clerks ([[Ander]] and [[Thistle]]) who help load and unload wagons, and who wait on customers when Barthen isn't around.
