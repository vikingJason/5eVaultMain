# Tresendsar Manor
## Overview
More a castle than a house, Tresendar Manor stands at the east edge of [[G6 - Town|town]] on a low hillside amid woods and thickets. The ancient manor has long been abandoned, but its cellars have been converted into a Redbrand stronghold. If the characters investigate this place, they find the entrance to the [[Redbrand Hideout|Redbrand hideout]].
