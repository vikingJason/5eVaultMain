# Phandalin
## Overview
In the northern foothills of the [[Sword Mountains]] lies the nondescript mining settlement of Phandalin. Although the village might not look like much, it provides a safe haven for adventurers eager to explore the surrounding wilderness, which is home to many old ruins and abandoned dwarven mines. A map of Phandalin appears in the Lost Mine of Phandelver adventure in the D&D Starter Set.

Phandalin is small, so the characters can visit multiple locations and NPCs throughout a given day. If the players choose to have their characters split up, they can cover more ground, but you'll have to take turns running each interaction for each player. Splitting the party also makes the "Redbrand Ruffians" encounter potentially more dangerous.
