# Stonehill Inn
## Overview
> [!note] Read-Aloud
> In the center of [[G6 - Town|town]] stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.
> 

This modest inn has six rooms for rent (Sildar Hallwinter takes one). If the characters decide to stay here, see "Food, Drink, and Lodging" in the rulebook for pricing. (The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the [[G6 - Town|town]], or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.)

The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named Toblen Stonehill. Toblen is a native of the [[G6 - Town|town]] of [[Triboar]] to the east. He came to [[Phandalin]] to prospect, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about mining. The new [[G6 - Town|town]] offered a good opportunity to become established. Toblen is upset that the Redbrands have been allowed to terrorize the [[G6 - Town|town]], and that Harbin Wester, the townmaster, has done nothing to curtail them. However, he tries not to stir up trouble for fear that the Redbrands might retaliate against his wife and children.
