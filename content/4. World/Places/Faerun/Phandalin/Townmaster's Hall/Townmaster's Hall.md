# Townmaster's Hall
## Overview
The [[G6 - Town|town]] master's hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at t he back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: "REWARD- Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the orc menace should inquire within." The notice bears the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s seal and an indecipherable signature.

[[Phandalin]] has no functioning government, but the townsfolk elect someone to serve as townmaster each year. The townmaster serves as a judge in minor disputes and keeps any records that need to be kept. The current [[G6 - Town|town]] mas ter is a male human banker named [[Harbin Wester]] - a fat, pompous old fool. Completely intimidated by the Redbrands, he claims that they're "just a mercenary guild, and not all that much trouble, really." The townmaster's hall has a small but serviceable jail in the cellar. The jail consists of two cells, and Harbin carries keys to the cell doors.
