[[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]] isn't the only community in [[Icewind Dale]]. Tribes of human barbarians called Reghed also operate in the area. Hunters and raiders who value strength and devotion to their ancestral heroes, they claim a great many heroes among their honored dead, including some who were responsible for the safety of [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]], [[Icewind Dale]], and beyond. A Reghed camp is made up of a large ring of hide tents, able to be broken down and transported as the Reghed move to keep up with the herds of reindeer they depend on for food and clothing.
