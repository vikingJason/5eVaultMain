## Background
The [[G6 - Town|town]] was nearly destroyed just prior to 1312 DR in the invasion of the [[Icewind Dale]] by the Legion of the Chimera. In 1356 DR, Bremen and [[Caer-Konig]] were given to the barbarians of [[Icewind Dale]] after the war with Akar Kessell and [[Revjak]] became the spokesperson for Bremen. The spokesman of the [[G6 - Town|town]] around the 1360s was Gil Haerngen, who, like other Bremenites, had a hobby of searching for gold and treasure in on the floodplains along the banks of the river. In 1482 DR, Catti-brie set up a home base in Bremen while waiting for her appointed rendez-vous with her friends.
