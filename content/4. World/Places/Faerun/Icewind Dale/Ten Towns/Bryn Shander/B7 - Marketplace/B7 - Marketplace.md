# B7 - Marketplace
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

**Type**: Military
#Organization/Military

The marketplace is a roughly circular space in the center of [[G6 - Town|town]] where local and foreign traders sell their wares. Tents and covered wagons provide some shelter against the cold wind, but not much. In a few places, campfires with people huddled around them crackle and smoke.

One heavily bundled figure commonly seen loitering about the market square is a haggard, homeless young woman named **[[Beldora (Homeless)|Beldora]]** (see appendix D). She wears boots that are much too big for her feet, and thick gloves made from walrus hide. She earns coin by helping to tend other folks' campfires, staying warm and overhearing rumors at the same time.

[[Beldora (Homeless)|Beldora]]'s secret is that she's a Harper agent. She likes to huddle next to strangers and learn what they know. She conceals a sending stone on her person and uses it once a day to pass along information to Thwip Ironbottom, a Harper agent based in [[Hundelstone]].
