# B3 - Council Hall
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Located near the southwest gate, the council hall is a nondescript warehouse where the speakers of [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]] engage in discussions about matters that concern their communities. When no meetings are in session, the building stands empty. In the event of a crisis that affects the other settlements of [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]], the council hall can be converted into a shelter for refugees.
