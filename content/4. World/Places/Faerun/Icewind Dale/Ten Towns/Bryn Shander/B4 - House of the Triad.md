# B4 - House of the Triad
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

[[Bryn Shander]]'s largest place of worship, the only one that truly deserves to be called a temple, is an impressive stone edifice built by the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn. The House of the Triad stands about halfway between the southwest gate and the central market. It honors the three gods known as the Triad: Tyr, the god of justice; Torm, the god of courage and self-sacrifice; and Ilmater, the god of endurance in the face of suffering.

The temple is attended and maintained by visiting priests and acolytes from [[Neverwinter]] and Waterdeep, who usually stay for no more than two years before returning whence they came. At present, the temple is home to a priest of Torm from [[Neverwinter]] named Dellvon Ludwig (LG male Illuskan human priest) and his faithful friend, Sirac ofSuzail (see appendix D).

Sirac knows that he's a son of the immortal Artus Cimber and thus carries the Cimber bloodline, not that it has ever benefited him. Artus's immortality, it is said, comes from a magic ring-a ring that Sirac has never seen. Sirac's parents gave him up as a baby; he was raised in an orphanage and learned his survival skills as a teenager living on the streets of Suzail. He traveled west with a caravan to Baldur's Gate, then sailed up the Sword Coast to [[Neverwinter]]. He came to [[Icewind Dale]] three months ago to try his hand at knucklehead trout fishing, and ended up befriending Dellvon Ludwig. Sirac has since come to appreciate Torm's mantra, espousing courage and heroism above all.
