# B5 - Speaker's Palace
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The Speaker's Palace is the private residence of the [[G6 - Town|town]] speaker. The "palace" part of its name is an overstatement, compared to such buildings elsewhere in the world. Yet, fashioned by dwarves out of cut stone, with a pitched slate roof and a colonnade in front, the palace is so out of place among the rough wood dwellings in [[Bryn Shander]] that it looks as if it had been magically transported here from some other region of Faerfin.

The current elected speaker, **[[Duvessa Shane]]** (see appendix D), is the daughter of a trader from Waterdeep who settled in [[Bryn Shander]] after she fell in love with a local tavern server. Duvessa inherited her mother's talent for negotiation and her father's charm, and she can argue and debate for hours without tiring. Others might bristle at her temerity, but she usually gets what she wants.
