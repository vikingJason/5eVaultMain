# B12 - Rendaril's Emporium
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This is the largest trade house in [[Bryn Shander]], on the site of the original cabin around which the [[G6 - Town|town]] sprang up. The entrance facing the market square serves as the storefront, where visitors can view an assortment of the finest goods for sale in all of [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]]: fishing rods fashioned from elven yew, yeti-skin coats with scrimshaw buttons, mithral fishhooks, axe heads and daggers crafted by the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn, and more. Around the back of the building is an entrance for wholesalers, where caravan traders offload their stock and local adventurers sell pelts and tusks collected on their travels. The owner, Rendaril (CG male half-elf **commoner**), is a shrewd merchant who learned his trade in the cutthroat markets ofWaterdeep. More coin passes through his hands in a week than most other businesses in [[Bryn Shander]] see in a season.
