# B6 - Town Hall
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

[[Bryn Shander]]'s [[G6 - Town|town]] hall is the largest building that borders the central square. It is reserved for community feasts and gatherings on various holy days and other notable events. The hall can also accommodate refugees from neighboring settlements in times of emergency.

In the back of the hall is a short flight of stone steps that lead down to a sunken cellar with walls of frozen, hard-packed earth. The cellar has been converted into a sheriff's office and an adjoining jail cell. The sheriff, **[[Markham Southwell]]** (see appendix D), spends little time here, and the jail cell is usually unoccupied. When troublemakers need to be locked up, two deputies {LN male or female Illuskan human **guards**) are assigned to watch over them. Sheriff Southwell carries the key to the cell door, which can be picked open with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If the guards need to get into the cell for some reason, one of them leaves to fetch the sheriff while the other waits.
