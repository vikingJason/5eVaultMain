# B11 - The Hooked Knucklehead
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This longstanding inn caters to the scrimshanders and traders who come to [[Bryn Shander]] from other towns to conduct business. The innkeeper, Barton (NG male Illuskan human **commoner**), doesn't meddle in his clients' affairs. The accommodations are meager, and the few private rooms lack hearths and are bitterly cold at night. Most of the clientele sleeps in the spacious common room, near the large stone hearth.
