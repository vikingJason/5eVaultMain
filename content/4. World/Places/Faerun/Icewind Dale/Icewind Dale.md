# Icewind Dale

## Overview

Go far enough north, and you will come to the mountains rightly called the [[Spine of the World]]. Turn west and go toward the S ea of Moving Ice, and you might eventu a lly come upon one of the scattered communities of Icewind Dale. You can a lso travel up the ever-narrowing road from [[Luskan]] called the [[Northern Means]], and eventually come upon the frozen tundra beyond. Why travel so fa r? Well, if you're like many who've drifted up there from the south, it is because an easier life doesn't suit you, you're running from something, or you just don't fit in anywhere else.

Icewind Dale has snow, ice, and freezing temperatures in abundance. [[The Sun|The sun]] never rises far above the horizon even at the height of summer-and the height of summer is a fleeting thing. Winter here is long and ruthless.

Icewind Dale is surrounded by perilous terrain. The ice cliffs of the [[Reghed Glacier]] rise up in the east like prison walls. The towering, snow-capped peaks of the [[Spine of the World]] loom to the south. To the north and west, the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] churns bergs and floes in an endless tumult, like winter grinding its teeth in anticipation of its next freezing assault. Between these formidable obstacles lies windswept tundra dotted with settlements and the occasional small forest or stand of trees.

A singular mountain called [[Kelvin's Cairn]] rises from the heart of Icewind Dale. During the summer, snow from [[Kelvin's Cairn]] flows into three mineral-rich lakes: Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. By midsummer, Icewind Dale shakes off the torpor of winter and comes forth in full flower. Grasses grow two or three feet high in the span of weeks. Birds flock to the marshes formed by the thawing soil, and reindeer calves fill out the herds that diminished in the winter.

Reghed barbarians follow the reindeer herds as they migrate across Icewind Dale, and dwarf miners haunt the caves and tunnels under [[Kelvin's Cairn]], rarely emerging except to trade ore for food. Most of lcewind Dale's inhabitants, however, live in ten permanent settle ments collectively known as [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]]:

- The walled [[G6 - Town|town]] of [[Bryn Shander]], which lies at the northern end of the [[Ten Trail]], is the first stop for most visiting merchants and traders and by far the largest of the ten communities.

- The hunting and fishing villages of [[Bremen]], [[Targos]], [[Termalaine]], and [[Lonelywood]] line the shores of Maer Dualdon, which feeds into the Shaengarne River and holds seemingly countless numbers of knucklehead trout.

- The villages of [[Dougan's Hole]] and [[Good Mead]] stand a few miles apart on the north shore of Redwaters which, contrary to its name, sparkles emerald green during the day and silver in the evening.

- The [[G6 - Town|town]] of [[Easthaven]] and, nestled among the foothills of [[Kelvin's Cairn]], the villages of [[Caer-Dineval]] and [[Caer-Konig]] hug the shores of Lac Dinneshere, which freezes in winter.

The population of [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]] is composed mostly of humans and dwarves, with the humans outnumbering the dwarves roughly twenty to one. In times of great peril, the leaders of [[Ten Towns|Ten-Towns]], known as [[G6 - Town|town]] speakers, meet at [[Bryn Shander]] to discuss solutions to their problems. If one of the smaller settlements comes under attack by a threat too great to overcome, its inhabitants are trained to flee to [[Bryn Shander]] and take shelter behind its walls.

## Random Encounters

When in this region, use the Random Encounters in Icewind Dale table instead of the Random Wilderness Encounters table earlier in this chapter.

### **Random Encounters in Icewind Dale**

| **`dice: d20`** | **Encounter** |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1 **ancient white dragon** |
| 2-5 | `dice: 1d4 + 2` **crag cats** (see appendix C) |
| 6-8 | 1 `dice: d3` **frost giants** |
| 9-12 | **Reghed barbarians** |
| 13-15 | `dice: 3d8` **reindeer** |
| 16-17 | Ten-Towners |
| 18-19 | `dice: 1d6` **yeti** |
| 20 | 1 **young remorhaz** |

#### **Encounter: Ancient White Dragon**

Arveiaturace, better known to Northfolk as Iceclaws, claims Icewind Dale as part of her domain. The characters catch sight of her in the sky overhead. Rarely does she condescend to meddle in the affairs of land dwellers; however, if one or more characters neglect to take cover, she swoops down for a closer look at them (and they at her).

The dragon is quite insane, and she wears a saddle to which is strapped the dead, withered corpse of a wizard she once regarded as a great friend. Arveiaturace occasionally calls out to the corpse in Draconic, as though the wizard were still alive. The dragon isn't hungry or spoiling for a fight. But if one or more characters refuse to cower before her, Arveiaturace might strafe them once with her breath weapon or try to snatch up one of them with her claws, grappling the victim instead of dealing damage on a hit, only to drop the poor fool from a perilous height several rounds later.

#### **Encountrt: Crag Cats**

The crag cats hide in the snow and attempt to surprise the party.

#### **Encounter: Frost Giants**

If a lone giant is encountered, it has a winter wolf companion. The frost giants are hunting for food. They have no treasure to speak of, though each carries a sack containing `dice: 1d4` mundane items, determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction.

#### **Encounter: Reghed Barbarians**

The characters come upon a Reghed berserker leading a band of `dice: 2d4+2` tribal warriors, or their encampment. Determine their tribe randomly by rolling a `dice: d4`:

| **`dice: d4`** | **Tribe** |
|---|---|
| 1 | Bear |
| 2 | Elk |
| 3 | Tiger |
| 4 | Wolf |

If the barbarians belong to the Bear tribe or the Elk tribe, they give the party a wide berth and attack only if threatened. (Anyone who approaches them with weapons drawn is considered a threat.) Barbarians belonging to the Tiger tribe or the Wolf tribe attack the party on sight. The Tiger barbarians want the party's rations, and the hungry Wolf barbarians want to murder the characters, skin them, and eat them.
