> [!warning]+ GM Directions
> While the village is full of cultists and those who cooperate with them, not everyone is willing to tolerate the cult’s presence. One man, Gundalin the Wheelwright, a human male who makes wheels and fixes axles for the merchants, woodsfolk, and others, wants the cult gone. If the characters look around for someone who is not a member of the cult, they might find him at [[The Golden Tankard|the Golden Tankard]] (where he says nothing) or at his small shop on the square. He often tries to catch their eye, but he is terrified of the cult and speaks only in a safe haven where he can’t be seen. He knows all of the information in the “ Rumors and Information” section.
