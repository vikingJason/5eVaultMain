# The Golden Tankard
## Overview
> [!note] Read-Aloud
> A yellow tankard hangs over the door of this rustic tavern. Inside, though, the place is short on cheer. All conversation stops and all eyes turn in your direction. A tall, heavyset man with enormous muttonchop sideburns steps forward and asks, “What can I get you travelers?”
> 

A visitor can buy a mug of beer for 3 cp or a mug of strong mead for 1 sp. There’s sausage on the menu as well as stewed cabbage and heavy black bread (4 cp for a plate full), but no one visits for the fine dining. It’s just enough to keep a visitor going another day, and no more than that.

If the characters sit and order ale, well and good.

> [!note] Read-Aloud
> “ I will send the pot boy out to you in a moment with the finest available in my humble tavern.” He goes toward the kitchen, bellowing for a cask.

The owner is [[Raggnar Redtooth]], who seems friendly enough but secretly takes bribes from the Cult of the Dragon. Strangers are never really welcome in his tavern, but they get service while he informs Captain Othelstan by sending a messenger. Raggnar has a violent past and is treated as an unarmored veteran (AC 10). He keeps his weapons behind the bar.

Prying information from Raggnar and his clientele is difficult. The villagers want to keep the characters occupied, and they ask for them to tell tales of their journey, they inquire about the characters’ families and where they are from, and they query how the party got here.

If asked about a place to sleep, Raggnar makes it clear that he isn’t an innkeeper: there are no beds or rooms, and even the stable is full. If anyone asks why, he gives his usual excuse: “Lord Marsten and his entourage are coming to hunt. All the servants are making things ready for their arrival.” (This is pure nonsense, of course—he has no rooms other than his own.) If the characters just wait a moment, Raggnar says he will offer them his own chambers, for a steep fee of 10 gp. “I’ll clear out a few things and it is all yours.” This is also a stalling tactic, though he’ll certainly take the money.

## Treasure
The Golden Tankard takes its name from a magic item that Raggnar found years ago: a golden stein decorated with dancing dwarves and grain patterns. This is a tankard of plenty. Speaking the command word (“Illefarn”) while grasping the handle fills the tankard with three pints of rich dwarven ale. This power can be used up to three times per day.
