# Shrine of Axes
## Overview
> [!note] Read-Aloud
> This wooden building is a shrine for woodcutters, and it combines several gods under one roof.
> 

A statue of Angharradh, an obscure elven deity representing spring, stands among statues of gods representing the other seasons, namely Auril (winter), Chauntea (summer), and Mielikki (autumn). Angharradh’s statue has been defaced by having her face and hands chopped away. A dead squirrel has been left at Auril’s feet.

The statue of Mielikki is not only freshly painted but also has a set of small cups, bits of bread, and other small sacrifices at its feet.
