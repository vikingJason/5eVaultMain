# Parnast Stable
## Overview
> [!note] Read-Aloud
> The two big doors leading into the stable are sealed, and the place looks shuttered.
> 

If the characters ask around, the villagers claim that the stable was put out of business some time ago. Anyone listening carefully hears a bellowing noise, though (no check required). The cult keeps two wyverns in the stable; sometimes, they unleash a wyvern-sized roar.

Cracked sheep bones and a few ox skulls cover the stable floor. Other than riding harnesses for the wyverns, there is no treasure here.

## Wyvern Riding
The wyverns in the stable (area 3) are trained to carry up to two Medium or six Small riders at a time. The difficult part is getting their harnesses attached so that riders don’t fall off, and giving the proper commands once airborne. Any character can put the harness on a wyvern with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. If the check fails by 5 or more, the wyvern strenuously objects and attacks the character once with its tail stinger as a reaction. The wyverns aren't choosy about who rides them, but convincing a wyvern to fly or move in a specific direction requires an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check; if the check fails, the wyvern ignores the rider’s commands until the rider’s next turn. After a rider succeeds on two such checks, the wyvern goes where the rider wants for the next hour, or until it takes damage or the rider dismounts.
