# G16 - Apple Orchard
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Many a bard has sung songs about [[Goldenfields]]' apple orchard; its old yet seemingly ageless trees yield thousands of baskets of tart apples every year. Much of the apple picking is performed by children, who climb the trees and gather the picked fruit in baskets, leaving them to be transported by adult workers. A grove of trees to the southeast of this area harbors a pair of young treants. Their job is to make sure no harm befalls the orchard.
