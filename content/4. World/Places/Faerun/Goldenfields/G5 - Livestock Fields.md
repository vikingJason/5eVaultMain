# G5 - Livestock Fields
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

On the outskirts of the [[G6 - Town|town]] are two large fields of roaming oxen and cattle, with cordoned-off pens for sheep, chickens, turkeys, and pigs. Each field is roughly a half-mile in diameter and enclosed by wooden fences with rearing horses carved into their posts. During the day, shepherds as well as workers with milk buckets and wool shears can be seen moving among the herds of cows and sheep.

One of the new shepherds, Shalvus Martholio (see appendix D), is a Zhentarim spy-a wolf in sheep's clothing, as it were. His assignment is to determine how easy it would be for the Black Network to gain control of [[Goldenfields]], and report his findings to Nalaskur Thaelond in [[Bargewright Inn]]. Shalvus often leaves the livestock pens to hang around [[G8 - Northfurrow's End|Northfurrow's End]]. He returns to the pens at night to check on the animals.
