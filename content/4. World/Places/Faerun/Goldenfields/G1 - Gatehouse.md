# G1 - Gatehouse
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The [[Northfurrow]] trail ends before a magnificent stone gatehouse carved with images of a full-bodied woman (representations of Chauntea) cradling cornucopias. The gatehouse is a fortress in its own right. Above its tall, thick wooden doors are arrow slits that seem to peer down suspiciously on all visitors.

The gatehouse has an inner set and an outer set of double doors. When locked, these doors are too thick to be forced open using brute strength. They can be damaged and broken down, however. Each set of doors has AC 16, 500 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

The gatehouse staff operates in three daily shifts that end at five bells in the morning, one bell in the afternoon, and nine bells at night, respectively. Each shift consists of a priest of Chauntea (NG male or female Illuskan human), four acolytes (NG male and female humans of mixed ethnicity), a hired mage (N male or female Illuskan human), ten scouts (N male and female humans of various ethnicities) hidden behind arrow slits, and thirty well-trained guards (N male and female humans of various ethnicities). The gatehouse castellan is a Waterdhavian noble who is appointed by the Masked L ords of Waterdeep and holds the post for a year, beginning on the first day of winter. The current castellan, a boorish twit named Hantanus Tarm (LN male Illuskan human noble), is responsible for defending the gates but has no military experience. The gatehouse guards report to him, but his position is seen as mostly political and ceremonial, and he has no influence anywhere but at the gatehouse. The gatehouse is spacious enough to accommodate the members of all three shifts, and any attack on the gates brings the full force of the gatehouse staff to bear.

Merchants and other visitors who come seeking food are rarely turned away, but their wagons and belongings are thoroughly searched in the gatehouse to make sure they contain nothing that could damage crops, such as rodents and vermin. Guests who want to spend the night are directed to [[G8 - Northfurrow's End|Northfurrow's End]] (area [[G8 - Northfurrow's End|G8]]).
