# G3 - Earth Mother's Bounty
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The first thing visitors to [[Goldenfields]] see as they pass through the gatehouse is a 20-foot-tall wooden statue of Chauntea, depicted as a plump, smiling woman standing with her hands on her hips in a [[Garden|garden]] of golden wheat, surrounded by a dirt roundabout. North of the statue is a stone building with an open front, above which hangs a sign that reads "Earth Mother's Bounty." Visitors can buy seeds and cornucopias here. Tasked by the abbot with overseeing the store and its inventory is Sevembra Tumbleleaf (LN female strongheart halfling druid), a member of the Emerald Enclave who sells nothing but the finest seeds. She also gives away lots of free samples.
