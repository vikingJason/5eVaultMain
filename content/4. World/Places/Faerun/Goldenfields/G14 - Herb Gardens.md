# G14 - Herb Gardens
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The road along the inside of [[Goldenfields]]' western wall detours around a pair of semicircular herb gardens. Stone cottages located nearby belong to a dozen druids (N male and female humans of various ethnicities), who worship Chauntea. The druids not only grow the herbs but also roam the fields and gardens of [[Goldenfields]], tending to sick plants.
