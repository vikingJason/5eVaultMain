# G9 - Goldengulp Brewery
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

[[Goldenfields]]' brewery is a stately, two-story manse where a beer called [[Goldengulp]] is made, using the finest local barley and hops. Visitors aren't allowed in the brewery, which is locked up tight at night. Longhouses in the brewery's front yard are home to the sixty commoners who comprise the brewery staff. In the same area is a locked stone warehouse packed to the rafters with casks of [[Goldengulp]]. A locked door can be picked open with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

Rising from the back of the brewery is a cylindrical watchtower, known to locals as the Dragon's Spire because a young bronze dragon once perched atop it on a quiet winter afternoon in 1374 DR, the Year of Lightning Storms. The stone tower serves as the headquarters for the Captain of the Guard, who is responsible for [[Goldenfields]]' defense. It has its own ground-floor entrance and is four stories tall, with a flat roof enclosed by green marble battlements. Two guards (CG male and female Illuskan humans) stand at the base of the tower, and four more stand watch atop it. The current Captain of the Guard is Strog Thunderblade (NG male half-ore veteran). Boredom and easy access to fine food and beer have made him fat and lackadaisical. He falls asleep early, wakes up late, and leaves the tower once a day around three bells in the afternoon to meet with the abbot and submit a daily report. Strog has a pleasant, easygoing demeanor, and the abbot likes him despite his obvious shortcomings.
