# G6 - Town
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The buildings that house most of the residents of [[Goldenfields]] are arranged in concentric half-rings around a central square where locals can socialize and gather for picnics after midday prayers. Orderly rows of wooden longhouses, each one large enough to house a hundred people, face inward toward a central plaza, with the abbey of Chauntea off to the southeast. Each longhouse is a work of art, its beams sculpted with images of a particular animal, thereby differentiating it from its neighbors. Most of [[Goldenfields]]' workers are human commoners. A handful of peaceful Chauntea worshipers (NG male and female druids of various races and ethnicities) live and work among them.

Wagons and wheelbarrows are parked just about everywhere, free for anyone to use. The oxen needed to pull the wagons are kept in the [[G5 - Livestock Fields|livestock fields]] (area GS).

A grove of trees south of town is home to three young treants. If the town or the abbey comes under attack, their job is to animate nearby trees and aid in the town's defense. The grove is also home to an awakened tree named Lifferlas (see appendix D). Created by a longdead druid, Lifferlas is the oldest living resident of Golden fields. It speaks Common and has long entertained the children of the workers with harrowing, often humorous tales of heroes and monsters, as well as legends about the gods, Chauntea in particular. The tree allows children to climb it while it walks about cautiously with hosts of them clinging to its boughs and screaming with delight.
