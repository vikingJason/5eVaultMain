# Shadowtop Cathedral
## Overview
A closely packed stand of towering shadowtop trees lies in the [[High Forest]]. The dark canopies of the trees form a high roof that permits only hints of sunlight to touch the ground beneath. Shadowtop Cathedral is an important meeting place for the Emerald Enclave. The forest within 50 miles of the site is seeded with **awakened trees** and **awakened shrub's** that are loyal to the enclave. These plants hide the trails that lead to Shadowtop Cathedral. If the awakened plants spot a creature openly wearing or carrying the symbol of the Emerald Enclave, the plants move aside to reveal hidden trails. Other creatures searching the forest for trails have disadvantage on ability checks made to find them and to avoid becoming lost.

When the characters first arrive at Shadowtop Cathedral, no one else is present, and there are no tracks on the ground. Each day at dawn, highsun, and dusk, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance that a friendly druid (NG male or female moon elf) visits the site. The druid doesn't stay long but urges characters seeking assistance to wait for the cathedral's caretaker to return. If they heed the druid's advice, assume that the caretaker returns at the next dawn.

The primary caretaker of Shadowtop Cathedral is a xenophobic, moss-covered treant named Turlang. He visits the site only occasionally. When he's not at the cathedral, Turlang wanders the forest, frightening off interlopers. He has the statistics of a treant, with 200 hit points and the following additional feature.

**Spellcasting**. Turlang is a 9th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15; +7 to hit with spell attacks).

He has the following druid spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): druidcraft, guidance, resistance

1st level (4 slots): detect magic, entangle, goodberry, speak with animals

2nd level (3 slots): animal messenger, gust of wind, pass without trace

3rd level (3 slots): plant growth, speak with plants

4th level (3 slots): conjure woodland beings, hallucinatory terrain

5th level (1 slot): commune with nature
