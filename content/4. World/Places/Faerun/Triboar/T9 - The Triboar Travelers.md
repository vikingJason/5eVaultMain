# T9 - The Triboar Travelers

## Overview

**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Merchant sponsors can hire the personnel and the vehicles of the [[Triboar]] Travelers to make caravan runs to Waterdeep and back, for 600 gp each way, plus 25 gp for each wagon beyond the tenth. Runs to [[Everlund]] and back are 800 gp each way, as monsters from the [[Evermoors]] are known to prey on caravans along this route, plus 30 gp for each wagon beyond the tenth. The company hires mercenaries and adventurers to serve as guards, paying each person 4 gp per day plus food and drink. Each guard also receives a bonus of 25 gp if all caravan goods arrive at the destination.

Urlam Stockspool (N male Illuskan human spy), a shrewd, immaculately dressed businessman, runs the caravan company and is a recruiter for the Black Network. He's proud of his affiliation: he lost an eye in combat several years ago and wears a red eye patch emblazoned with the black serpent symbol of the Zhentarim. Urlam is rarely seen without his suave bodyguard, Valken Naspeer (N male half-elf assassin). Although Urlam and Valken are good-humored and speak highly of the local authorities, they know that the lord protector keeps a watchful eye on them. They have no idea that Darathra is affiliated with the Harpers, but it wouldn't surprise them to learn as much. At any given time, the bunkhouse next to Urlam's residence holds `dice: 2d6` Zhentarim caravan guards (N male and female human thugs of various ethnicities) waiting for their next job.

Characters might approach Urlam looking for work. He has nothing for them unless one or more characters are members of the Black Network, in which case he gives them a quest. If they complete the quest, he gives them another until they've completed three quests. The three quests are as follows, and every quest the characters complete earns them a 500 gp gemstone as payment:

- Urlam suspects that Othovir (see area Tll) is hiding a secret, and he wants to know what it is. To complete this quest, the characters must learn that Othovir has blood ties to House Margaster in Waterdeep. Othovir won't divulge this information willingly, so the characters must either charm or interrogate Othovir to learn the truth.

- Urlam is convinced that Tolmara Hysstryn (see area [[T14 - Six Windows|T14]]) has a secret, and he wants to know what it is. The characters can complete this quest by finding Tolmara's dead husband in the attic of the [[T14 - Six Windows|Six Windows]] rooming house.

- Urlam believes that Nemyth (see area [[T16 - The Triboar Arms|T16]]) has a secret, and he wants to know what it is. In truth, Nemyth has no secrets, and Urlam's belief stems from prejudice toward tieflings. If the characters wish to complete this quest, they must contrive a secret and convince Urlam of its veracity, which can be accomplished with a successful Charisma (Deception) check contested by Urlam's Wisdom (Insight) check.
