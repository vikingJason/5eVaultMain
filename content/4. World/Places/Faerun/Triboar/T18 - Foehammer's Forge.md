# T18 - Foehammer's Forge
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

**Ghelryn Foehammer** (see appendix D) makes fine weapons, armor, and other metalworks. Ghelryn is getting a bit long in the tooth for the daily grind of metalsmithing, so he's looking for a skilled apprentice, but no one has met with his approval so far. A year ago, Ghelryn made splendid suits of ceremonial armor for King Morinn and Queen Tithmel of [[Citadel Felbarr]], and the royals were so impressed that they bestowed upon Ghelryn the honorary title of Royal Armorer. For that and other reasons, the Foehammer name is synonymous with top-quality goods throughout the [[Dessarin Valley]], and Ghelryn intends to keep it that way.

Ghelryn hates ores and giants. During the War of the [[Silver Marches]], he obtained reports of ores and giants attacking dwarfholds throughout the North. Many times he wanted to take up arms and travel north to join the war, yet he restrained himself because he had a business to run. But when giants attack [[Triboar]], he refuses to stand back and idly watch.
