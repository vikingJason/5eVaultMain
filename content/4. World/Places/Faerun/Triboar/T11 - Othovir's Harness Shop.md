# T11 - Othovir's Harness Shop
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

A skilled harness-maker named **Otbovir** (see appendix D) lives and works here, making the finest elk-skin harnesses in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. He hunts the elk, keeps their skins, and sells the rest to the Lionshield Coster (area [[T6 - The Lion's Share|T6]]). His harnesses have elaborate designs pressed into the leather, and his work is popular among Waterdhavian nobles who enjoy horseback riding. Although he hails from a prominent Waterdeep family (the Margasters), Othovir never speaks of his past or his family, and he has no interest in describing how he ended up a shop owner in [[Triboar]]. The truth is, several members of Othovir's family are secret worshipers of Asmodeus, and he wants nothing to do with that.
