# T20 - Everwyvern House
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This expensive inn caters to Waterdhavian nobility and other well-to-do folk who wouldn't be caught dead in a more modest establishment. The property is situated behind [[T21 - The Pleasing Platter|the Pleasing Platter]] (area [[T21 - The Pleasing Platter|T21]]) on a beautifully landscaped patch of land with private stables, private gardens, and a meandering path through a small orchard. The inn itself is a beautiful stone building with lamps hanging from its eaves and a turret in one corner.

The snobbery of Everwyvern House is equaled by its elegant foppery. The atmosphere in the place is like a parody of the grandest Waterdhavian noble parties. Folk come here to be awed by it, to be amused by it, or to feel at home in it. Minstrels play quiet background music among floating plants and many-hued driftglobes, while startlingly gowned women and dashingly sashed and ruffled men chat, stroll, dance, and sneer at each other. Several of these well-dressed fops are actually escorts (N male and female human **commoners** of various ethnicities) employed by the inn's proprietor to enhance the mood. They are coached to speak and parade about like nobles, but they are nothing more than low-paid actors.

The Everwyvern's condescending peacock of a proprietor, Draven Millovyr (NE male Illuskan human **mage**), tried and failed to gain membership in the Arcane Brotherhood. When that career path didn't pan out, he used his inherited wealth to buy Everwyvern House. The Everwy vern's beds are comfortable but horribly overpriced (15 gp per night), though the fee includes room service and companionship, if desired. The meals on the menu are prepared just as they are in Waterdeep's finest restaurants, but nonetheless they are extraordinarily expensive (25 gp per plate). Draven employs spies to keep him apprised of the latest dining and fashion trends.

Draven doesn't allow "nobodies" to stay at his inn, and he employs six bouncers (NE male Illuskan human **thugs**) to throw out the trash. Adventurers of noble blood and their servants are welcome; others are not.

Draven keeps his wealth in his locked quarters, located on the top floor of the Everwy vern's turret. He carries the only key to the door. Its lock can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. A glyph of warding spell cast on the door is triggered when someone other than Draven opens it. When triggered, the glyph casts a corifure animals spell that summons a pair of **death dogs**. They attack anyone not accompanied by Draven.

**Treasure**. A locked chest in Draven's quarters contains 540 gp in mixed coinage-funds that Draven uses to pay his staff and maintain his "modest" lifestyle. A secret compartment in the chest's lid holds three bejeweled necklaces (stolen from visiting Waterdhavian noblewomen) worth 750 gp each. The compartment can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Draven carries the key to the chest, which can otherwise be opened with thieves' tools and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check.
