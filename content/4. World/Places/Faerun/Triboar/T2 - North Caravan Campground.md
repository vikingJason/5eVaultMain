# T2 - North Caravan Campground
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

Caravans passing through [[Triboar]] use this fenced-in field as a place to park their wagons and contain their oxen for free. There's also plenty of room to pitch tents and build campfires. Fresh water can be drawn from a 30-foot-deep stone well in the southeast comer of the yard.

A [[C - Cottage|cottage]] stands in the east comer of the lot. Its elderly occupant, **Darz Helgar** (see appendix D), is paid by the lord protector to keep the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s campgrounds clean by removing the garbage and burying the excrement. Darz has also buried his shady past; he was a member of a thieves' guild in Waterdeep who was caught and imprisoned for his many crimes. After his release from prison, he moved to [[Triboar]] to start a new life.
