# T5 - Wainwright's Wagons
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

A longtime fixture in [[Triboar]], Wainwright's Wagons has its own horse-driven sawmill and large buildings for lumber storage. The establishment originally catered to the wealthy elite by crafting the finest, most expensive wagons in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. The current owner, Tasker Wainwright (N male Illuskan human commoner), is more interested in profit than quality. Lacking the carpentry skills of his ancestors, he relies on underpaid apprentices to assemble wagons that are little better than ordinary, yet they cost five times as much. The Wainwright brand name is the only thing keeping the establishment in business ... for now.
