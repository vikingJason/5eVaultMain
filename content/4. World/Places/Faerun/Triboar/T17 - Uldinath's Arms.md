# T17 - Uldinath's Arms
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This hilltop smithy across the road from [[T18 - Foehammer's Forge|Foehammer's Forge]] (area [[T18 - Foehammer's Forge|T18]]) is run by Harriet Uldinath (LG female Illuskan human **commoner**), the great-granddaughter of the establishment's founder. Harriet has known Ghelryn Foehammer since she was a child, and the two are friendly rivals. Harriet sells fine weapons stamped with the Uldinath family glyph, which generally increases their value by 25 percent.
