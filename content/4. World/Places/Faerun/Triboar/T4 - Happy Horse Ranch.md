# T4 - Happy Horse Ranch
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The Kamveller family raises, trains, sells, and stables horses. Three large buildings stand on their property: a two-story log house with a detached outhouse (the family estate); a stone storehouse full of used saddles, bridles, and reins; and stone stables connected to a fenced-in riding yard and grazing field.

**Janele Kamveller** (NG female Chondathan human **commoner**) is the family matriarch, a feisty middle-aged widow who enjoys the company of horses more than people. She has three adult sons named Aldo, Hingo, and Rasko (LG male Chondathan human **veterans**), all of whom are members of the [[G6 - Town|town]] militia.
