# T1 - Market Square and Tower
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The center of [[Triboar]], where the Long Road meets the Evermoor Way, is a huge open space used as a market by local farmers and visiting peddlers. Dominating the space is the two-story Tower of the Lord Protector, a simple stone keep that leans decidedly to the east. Hanging above the entrance is the dusty banner of the lord protector, which depicts three black boars running toward the head of the banner on a blood-red field.

The current Lord Protector of [[Triboar]] is **Darathra Shendrel** (see appendix D), a Harper agent from Waterdeep elected by the people of [[Triboar]] to command the [[G6 - Town|town]] militia, settle disputes, and keep the peace. Her association with the Harpers is not widely known, but she is widely regarded as a fair and clear-headed leader.

The regular militia takes turns serving in the Twelve, a mounted police force (good-aligned male and female human **veterans** of various ethnicities on **riding horses**) that patrols the [[G6 - Town|town]], the roads that lead between the outlying ranches, and the eastern half of the Tri boar Trail. If needed, Darathra can muster a well-armed militia of fifty in the night, and three hundred by highsun the next day. The lord protector also has the authority to draft mercenaries and adventurers, as needed.
