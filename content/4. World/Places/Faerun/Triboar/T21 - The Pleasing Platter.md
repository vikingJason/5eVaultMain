# T21 - The Pleasing Platter
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

This fine restaurant is next door to the grandiose [[T20 - Everwyvern House|Everwyvern House]], and it has adopted similar pretensions. Its tables are far apart. Each is screened from the others by strategically placed plants, statues, or pillars. Minstrels play soft and soothing music in the background. Service is fast, polite, and deft, with special requests honored swiftly and obligingly to meet a guest's culinary preferences. House specialties include smoked quail, rothe steak cooked in wine and nuts, and grilled silver-tail fish. Prices are comparable to those at [[T20 - Everwyvern House|Everwyvern House]], and free flasks of sweet water (see area [[T23 - Apothecary|T23]]) are served with dinner. The owners and chefs are Heltzer and Pentavasta Duncask (LG male and female Illuskan human **commoners**), a cheerful and randy older couple.
