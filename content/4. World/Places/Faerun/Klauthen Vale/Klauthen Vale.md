# Klauthen Vale
## Overview
Klauthen Vale is a narrow, winding valley in the mountains west of [[Mirabar]]. Thanks to ancient and powerful magic, the valley is warm throughout of the year-an oasis in the cold, cold north. Roaming this expanse are hundreds of sheep, goats, and cattle plucked from other regions of the North by the vale's dread overlord, the red wyrm [[Klauth]]. Scattered here and there are the crushed or charred bones of powerful adventurers and entire ore hordes that dared to enter the valley.

"Old Snarl," as [[Klauth]] is also known, likes to lie on a ledge high on one of the valley walls and survey his domain, descending occasionally to snatch up an animal or intruder. The walls around the valley contain numerous caves, two of them large enough for [[Klauth]] to shelter in. He keeps his legendary hoard in tunnels beneath one cavern, which can be entered only by lifting or pushing aside a massive slab of stone-a task impossible for anyone not as large and strong as an ancient dragon.

[[Klauth]] is one of the largest and most fearsome red dragons ever known in Faeriln. Huge but graceful, he's as supple as a cat. His body is covered in old, wicked- looking scars where scales have been torn away and never grown back. He brutally attacks other dragons, seeking to slay any wyrm that might rival him in power, m a fighting style marked by sudden attacks and just as sudden disappearances.

[[Klauth]] spends many waking hours scrying FaerO.n with his spells, and he probably knows more about the deeds and whereabouts of surface-world creatures in the North and along the Sword Coast than any other being alive today. Old Snarl obeys strange whims that prompt him to perform acts of kindness for creatures he doesn't think can harm him. Such a whim leads him to give the adventurers a gift to expedite their travels across the North (see the "Airship of a Cult" section in chapter 4, "The Chosen Path").

## Sugested Encounter
[[Klauth]] spies on trespassers from afar. If the characters harm his animals or get too nosy, a sudden rage overcomes him, and he launches a series of hit-and-run attacks. Jets of fire and bolts of lightning spring forth as he swoops down on foes-the discharges of wands he has learned to control. All of Klauthen Vale is considered his lair, and he can use his lair actions anywhere within it.

[[Klauth]] is an ancient red dragon, with the following additional features that increase his challenge rating to 25 (75,000 XP):

**Dual Wand Wielder**. If [[Klauth]] is carrying two wands, he can use an action to expend 1 charge from each wand, triggering the effects of both wands simultaneously.

**Special Equipment**. [[Klauth]] carries a wand offi reballs and a wand of lightning bolts, and he wears a ring of cold resistance.

**Innate Spellcasting**. [[Klauth]]'s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 1/day each: banishment, etherealness,find the path, locate object, prismatic spray, suggestion
