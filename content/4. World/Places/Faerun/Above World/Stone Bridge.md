# Stone Bridge
## Overview
A gigantic stone archway, two miles from end to end and four hundred feet tall at its apex, comfortably spans the Dessarin River and the plain around it, remaining high and dry during even the worst springtime floods. The Stone Bridge is a sacred site of pilgrimage for many dwarves. Long ago, the dwarf god Moradin appeared atop the bridge to rally dwarves of the Ironstar clan against a horde of ores, and the founder of the ancient dwarven kingdom of Besilmer, Torhild Flametongue, died fighting a hill giant in the same location. The Stone Bridge is made of smooth, fused granite. It is only 15 feet wide and lacks railings or barriers, so anyone traversing it is at the mercy of the wind.

This gigantic stone archway (two miles long and four hundred feet high) comfortably spans the widest spring flood of the Dessarin River. It is a sacred site of pilgrimage for many dwarves. Long ago, the dwarf god Moradin appeared atop the Stone Bridge to rally dwarves of the Ironstar clan against a horde of ores. The founder of Besilmer, King Torhild Flametongue, died fighting a hill giant atop the Stone Bridge. (He is entombed within the Halls ofthe Hunting Axe.)    Built to connect those parts ofthe dwarven realm of Besilmer on both the western and eastern banks of the Dessarin, the Stone Bridge is made of smooth, fused hard granite. It is only six paces wide and lacks railings or barriers, so anyone atop it is at the mercy of the wind, particularly in winter.

**Reason to Visit**. The Stone Bridge is the only crossing of the Dessarin River between Ironford and Yartar; travelers and caravans frequently use it (with care).

## Suggested Encounter
The first time the adventurers approach the midpoint ofthe bridge, they see a **fire giant** and a **hell hound** approaching from the opposite direction. The fire giant, Stolvor, isn't carrying any rocks or valuables, but he clutches an enormous greatsword and has a rod of the Vonindod (see appendix B) tucked in his belt. He and his hound have been searching for fragments of the Vonindod (with no luck) and are spoiling for a fight. They charge into battle, the hell hound advancing in front. If their enemies flee, they pursue.

A creature can try to push another creature off the bridge by shoving it, using the rules for "Shoving a Creature" in chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook. Any creature that is successfully shoved in this way must succeed on DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the river below, taking 70 (`dice: 20d6`) bludgeoning damage.
