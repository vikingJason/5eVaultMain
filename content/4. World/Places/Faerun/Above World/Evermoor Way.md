# Evermoor Way
## Overview
The Evermoor Way has long been a vital trade route, connecting the settlements of the Dessarin Va11ey with those of the [[Silver Marches]]. The section between [[Triboar]] and [[Yartar]] is an ancient road, relatively flat and composed of tight-fitting stones. East ofYartar, the road becomes a gravel and dirt wagon trail that passes a little too close to the [[Evermoors]] for most merchants' comfort. Between [[Olostin's Hold]] and [[Everlund]], the trail passes through an area that used to be forest and is now full of tree stumps. Efforts to turn this long stretch into a proper road have long been thwarted by disagreements between the leaders ofYartar and [[Everlund]], and [[Everlund]]'s exit from the Lords' Alliance has dashed all hope.
