# Secomber
## Overview
This [[G6 - Town|town]] of farmers, fishers, brewers, and stonecutters is perched on three hills located near the confluence of the Unicorn Run and the Delimbiyr River. Beneath these hills lie ruins that were once part of Athalantar, a bygone kingdom. The townsfolk have turned the buried ruins into cellars, larders, and shelters.

Secomber is under the heel of the Urshani hobgoblins, who dwell in the [[High Moor]] and demand tribute several times a year. Secomber has no defense against the Urshani. Its residents give the hobgoblins food, homemade ale, and ore to retain their freedom. The hobgoblins' demands have left the community impoverished.

## Suggested Encounter
The characters arrive to find two **cloud giants** named Nirva andJaral sitting in the middle of [[G6 - Town|town]], listening to townsfolk talk about the founding of Secomber and the ancient kingdom of Athalantar, on whose bones the [[G6 - Town|town]] was built. Despite their intimidating size, the giants (who are neutral good in alignment) mean no harm. They recently found an artifact-half of a giant-sized vase-in the [[High Moor]], and they're widening their search for other evidence of a cloud giant castle that crashed in this area thousands of years ago. Nirva and Jara! are siblings on a quest. They want to elevate cloud giants (and themselves) to the top of the ordning by finding maps to ancient Ostorian ruins and long-buried treasure vaults. The castle they seek is rumored to hold maps that could prove useful in their search.

Nirva and Jara try not to overstay their welcome. After listening quietly to the locals' stories, they bid the townsfolk farewell and fly back to their castle, which has landed in the [[High Moor]] (and is obscured by fog). The castle has another ten **cloud giants** aboard-guards loyal to Nirva and Jara!. If the characters question the **cloud giants**
