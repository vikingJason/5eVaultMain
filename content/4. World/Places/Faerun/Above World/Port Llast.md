# Port Llast
## Overview
This coastal [[G6 - Town|town]] has been, at various points in its violent history, plundered by pirates, enslaved by evil cults, set ablaze, overrun by sahuagin, and even raided by drow-yet it weathered every storm and until recently showed glimmers of renewed prosperity once more. It's the only port between [[Luskan]] and [[Neverwinter]], and the only place between the two cities where tall cliffs give way to sandy shores. Port Llast's harbor is strewn with shipwrecks-the tombs of seafarers who fought for the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s spoils and lost.

## Suggested Encounter
Port Llast has fallen once more, this time to marauding frost giants whose greatship has run aground on two smaller wrecked ships in the harbor roughly 60 feet from shore. Frost giants have already attacked the [[G6 - Town|town]] once in the past month; this is their second raid. Twenty frost giants have descended upon the fog-shrouded [[G6 - Town|town]] and are plundering it for food, ale, and other supplies. The streets are littered with the crushed and cloven remains of townsfolk who stood their ground.

The heavy fog makes dealing with the frost giants a bit easier, allowing characters to pick them off one or two at a time. A creature can see out to a range of 60 feet in the fog. The area beyond that is heavily obscured.

The giants left two **winter wolves** aboard the greatship to guard it (see the "[[Svardborg]]: General Features" sidebar in chapter 7, "Berg of the Frost Giants"). The wolves attack any characters who board the vessel. If one wolf dies, the other wolf uses its next action to howl a warning to the frost giants. If there are any frost giants still alive in [[G6 - Town|town]], they quickly return to the ship. Half of the giants take 5 rounds to reach the ship; the remaining giants take 10 rounds.

## Treasure
Characters who defeat the winter wolves and search the greatship find six crates of plundered foodstuffs, fifteen empty ale barrels, a lidless wooden chest containing 3,000 sp, a sleigh laden with animal pelts (worth 300 gp for the lot), and twenty giant sacks, each containing ld6 x 100 gp and one mundane item. You can roll on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction for each mundane item, or forgo the rolls and choose twenty items from the table. The fattest sack also contains one magic item, determined by rolling on Magic Item Table F in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.
