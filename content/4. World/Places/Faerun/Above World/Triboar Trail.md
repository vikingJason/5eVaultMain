# Triboar Trail
## Overview
This path meanders south of [[Neverwinter Wood]], connecting the [[High Road]] to the [[Long Road]]. It's the safest overland route between the [[Dessarin Valley]] and [[Neverwinter]]. Orcs and goblinoids prey on travelers from time to time, but copper dragons in the northern foothills of the [[Sword Mountains]] help thin out the monsters' ranks.
