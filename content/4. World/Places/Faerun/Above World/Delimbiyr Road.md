# Delimbiyr Road
## Overview
Also called the Shining Trail, the Delimbiyr Road is a trade road that follows the north shore of the Delimbiyr River. Terrified refugees heading west along the road warn adventurers of rampaging stone giants to the east. They claim that the giants have destroyed homesteads and settlements throughout [[Grayvale]], and that [[Loudwater]] is doomed to fall as well.
