# Gundarlun
## Overview
The island nation of Gundarlun (see map 3.10) is a string of barren mountains rising up out of the Trackless Sea. Mighty waves crash against its rocky shores. Clinging to the mountainsides above the water are stone keeps with fishing villages huddled around them, each one ruled by a ruthless jar! who answers to the King of Gundarlun, Olgrave Redaxe (CN male Illuskan human berserker with 90 hit points). The king lives in a crumbling fortress that overlooks [[Gundbarg]], the island's only port.
