# Long Road
## Overview
The Long Road, one of the North's busiest trade routes, begins at the gates of [[Mirabar]] and continues for hundreds of miles southward through the [[Dessarin Valley]], meeting the [[High Road]] just north ofWaterdeep. Many towns and villages lie along the route and depend on the relative safety that the Long Road provides for caravans and other travelers. Unfortunately for those travelers, the road is far too long to be defended properly along its entire length, and attacks by bandits, barbarians, and monsters are all too frequent in some areas.
