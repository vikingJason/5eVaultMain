# Spine of the World
## Overview
Mountains of ice and black rock form a sky-scraping wall of frigid peaks across the far north, which few creatures have the ability to surmount. Brutally cold winds, avalanches, and icy rifts are the least of a traveler's problems in the Spine of the World. Tribes of giants, goblinoids, and ores dwell there, holding every cavern or abandoned dwarven delve but those claimed by dragons.
