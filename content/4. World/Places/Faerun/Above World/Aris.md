![[Castle Aris.png|right|600]]

Castle Aris is the ancestral home of the Duke of Aris. It is the main fortification, logically, of the Duchy of Aris, which covers a vast area that includes all the land between the Stormhorns and the Sunset Mountains, and as far south as the edge of the Marsh of Tun. It is not a glamourous landscape, consisting mostly marshes and swamps, but its defensive significance means the Dukes of Aris have always enjoyed a high standing at court in Suzail.  
It stands as the outer most bastion against Anauroch and the Stonelands to the north and the untamed lands to the west. The patrols out of this fortification also guard all the major roads in and out of this region.

The garrison is substantial, getting most of their supplies through High Horn. The castle itself is showing its age. Although formidable, it is in need of repairs, and some are indeed underway. There are also several small houses clustered around the walls, seeking as much safety as they can from the lands to the south.
