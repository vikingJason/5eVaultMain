## History
Arabel was almost as old as [[Suzail]]. It began as a logging camp, and maintained a degree of independence. The first rebellion occurred during the reign of King Tharyann, who put an end to it. By 245 DR, Arabel was in rebellion again. By 376 DR, Arabel had seceded three times

Another rebellion occurred some time between 376 DR and 432 DR, caused by a "Merchants' Revolutionary Committee". A battle in the Stonelands caused orcs to be driven south, and although this would normally be enough to cause Arabel to rejoin Cormyr, there was no military aid available, and the orcs conquered the heart of the King's Forest.

In 1018 DR, Arabel was attacked by a pair of green dragons.

The Usurper King Gondegal seized power in Arabel in 1352 DR with the aim of using the city as a central location for the formation of a new kingdom. He was overthrown eight days later by the Cormyrean army, led by King Azoun IV.

During the [[1358 - Time of Troubles|Time of Troubles]], the goddess Tymora, Lady Luck herself, protected the city.

In 1368 DR, heavy rain lasted for two entire seasons, spring and summer. This downpour caused a sinkhole underneath stables of a respectable Arabellan inn, within a hundred steps of the Lady's Hall, the temple of Tymora. The collapsed building exposed a hidden shrine to Beshaba and killed thirty-seven worshipers of Lady Luck's hateful sister Beshaba. Lord Priest Doust Sulwood, along with the High Lord Priest Daramos Lauthyr of the Lady's Hall, were present during the excavation of the destroyed shrine. One of the dead worshipers of Beshaba belonged to the respected Marliir noble family. Daramos Lauthyr chose to lie about the noble's association and claim that the dead Marliir was at the stables when the disaster struck. The High Priest wanted to play the game of politics. Many attributed the flooding to [[Chauntea]], but the Church of Tymora was sure it was Lady Luck's doing. Lauthyr planned to petition with Lady Lord Myrmeen Lhal to claim the land of Beshaba's ruined shrine for his church, placing a rectory or a cleric school there. However, the same collapse caused one of the springs in Arabel to change its path and pour directly into Tymora's temple's scriptorium and the library, dealing significant damage to the church's tomes and scrolls.

As of 1372 DR, it was ruled by Myrmeen Lhal. It was one of the cities damaged in the Goblin War.
