# Daggerford

## Overview

### Daggerford (Map)

Built on a hillside in the floodplain of the Delimbiyr River, the walled [[G6 - Town|town]] of Daggerford is dominated by a three-story keep that belongs to its duchess, Morwen Daggerford. From atop Daggerford's walls, dozens of farms and a scattering of hamlets are visible, all under the protection of the duchess and the Lords' Alliance.

Unknown to Daggerford's citizens, a **succubus** named Pencheska has usurped Morwen's identity and now governs in her stead. The succubus has imprisoned the real duchess in Cromm's Hold, a keep on the edge of the [[Lizard Marsh]] (see the "[[Lizard Marsh]]" entry for details). Pencheska is using her position to infiltrate the Lords' Alliance. She rules Daggerford much as Lady Morwen did, sternly but fairly, and does little to arouse suspicion.

Recently, hill giants ranging south of the [[Forlorn Hills]] have begun to encroach upon the farmlands and noble estates around Daggerford. The succubus, hoping to appear benevolent, is readying the [[G6 - Town|town]] to accommodate farmers looking for sanctuary, and the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s outer walls bristle with lookouts. The "duchess" has also raised taxes to pay for Zhentarim mercenaries to patrol the lands north of Daggerford. Pencheska has forged a promising alliance with the Black Network, and her primary Zhentarim contact in [[G6 - Town|town]] is a plump halfling weasel named Nelkin Danniker (N male lightfoot halfling **spy**), known to his associates as the Snail because of his slow, deliberate way of talking. The Snail relaxes at the River Shining Tavern and Inn, watched over by `dice: 1d6` **thugs** (N male and female humans of various ethnicities) posing as nondescript inn patrons.

Another popular tavern in [[G6 - Town|town]], the Happy Cow, is run by Koggin and Lily Hardcheese (LG male and female strongheart halfling commoners). Koggin also operates a money-lending enterprise out of the tavern and employs several other family members to help run both businesses, including three brothers and three sisters, a dozen nieces and nephews, and several distant relations. One of the Happy Cow's regular patrons is a female half-elf named Zira, who is actually an **adult bronze dragon** named Zirazylym in polymorphed form. Zira is fond of the Hardcheese family and doesn't meddle in their business. She avoids contact with the characters unless events involving the Black Network bring them together (see the "Shalvus Martholio's Quest" section in chapter 2)

Built against the side of a low hill on the floodplains of the Delimbiyr, this small, walled [[G6 - Town|town]] is dominated by the keep of the local duchess, Lady Morwen Daggerford. Counting the [[G6 - Town|town]] itself and the nearby hamlets and farms that look to it for protection and guidance, some twelve hundred people call the area home. Lady Morwen is the sister of the previous duke, Maldwyn Daggerford, and she seems a capable and charismatic leader. The Daggerford family's authority over the area dates back to the ancient Kingdom of'Man that succeeded Phalorm in the region. Though that realm has been dust for centuries, there are those that see Daggerford as the last bastion of a better time of peace, wealth, and influence- a time that, given the right leadership, has the smallest of chances of being restored.

Daggerford is a pastoral haven. Wide, sprawling hills nearby offer peaceful vistas, but are sometimes overrun by raiding ores or goblins. The frequent caravans heading north to [[Waterdeep]] or south to Baldur's Gate need escort or guarding, and can offer news of both of those cities (and the settlements between them). Several inns stand ready to accept visitors, except in the busiest of trade or festival periods, when they fill swiftly, and many locals open up their homes to lodgers. Warriors in need of coin can help their purses by offering their services as trainers for the local militia, or accompanying the [[G6 - Town|town]] guard on its patrols.

Daily rulership is in the hands of the Council of Guilds, composed of the heads of the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s informal trade groups. These guildmasters believe themselves more powerful and influential than they truly are, imitating the Lords ofWaterdeep by going robed and masked to council meetings. This charade, in the eyes of most, borders on farce, as everyone in Daggerford knows precisely who the council members are, and no magic disguises the forms, voices, or mannerisms of the guild leaders, and a trained spy can learn which guildmaster is which after only an evening or two of proper observation.

The largest and oldest building in Daggerford is the ducal castle, a three-level keep enclosed by a two-story wall that contains its own smithy, a wide parade ground, and stabling for a large number of animals. The dukes of Daggerford have always kept a well-stocked larder, capable of feeding the castle's inhabitants and any citizens that might shelter inside during a siege.

Three gates lead into the [[G6 - Town|town]] of Daggerford: River Gate, which provides access to the river, and through which shipping cargo is carted into the [[G6 - Town|town]] proper; Caravan Gate, which handles most landgoing traffic, including land-based trade; and Farmers' Gate, which remains open at nearly all times, but is wide enough only to let one wagon or cart pass at a time.

A militia guards Daggerford. Militia service is mandatory for all able-bodied adults, and lasts for twenty years. All citizens living within the [[G6 - Town|town]] receive instruction from the duchess's own soldiers in the use of spears and other weapons, and must spend at least one day a month in defense of the [[G6 - Town|town]], standing sentry on its walls or patrolling the nearby roads. Their training means that the common citizens of Daggerford aren't easily cowed by armed folk demanding goods, coin, or passage, and are slightly more likely to take up work as mercenaries, caravan guards, or adventurers.

Although she is less amiable than her brother was, Lady Morwen is acknowledged as more capable of ruling Daggerford than Duke Maldwyn had been. She is well liked by the people, who understand that she has an honorable heart, and wishes what is best for Daggerford. She regularly trains with the militia, and is seen in the [[G6 - Town|town]] wearing armor just as often as she is adorned

in the finery befitting her station. She often visits the local shrine to Tempus, which only enhances her reputation as a pious woman. Lady Morwen's features are only now starting to age, as though catching up with her white hair.

Most folk of Daggerford know one another, at least casually, by sight. Strangers are usually welcome, especially if they have coin to spend, unless such folk come armed and belligerent through the [[G6 - Town|town]]. Guards stationed at each gate make note of new faces, but don't take action against those they don't recognize unless they are given reason to do so.

The largest of the [[G6 - Town|town]]'s inns, the River Shining Tavern, is the second biggest building in Daggerford, and the site of many local celebrations and gatherings. Here, the wealthy come to eat and relax. The inn is old- many locals claim it to be older even than the ducal castle- and to many, is the very soul of Daggerford. The Silver Flood Inn and Lizard's Gizzard also offer rooms, though the latter has no food to provide its guests, only beds.

One of Daggerford's most unusual businesses is the Sword Coast Traders' Bank, which accepts deposits from traveling merchants and enables them to receive these funds at a similar location in either [[Waterdeep]] or Baldur's Gate. Lady Belinda Anteos (of the [[Waterdeep]] noble house) promises that her business is secure and that the bank's magical means of communicating precise amounts of currency between cities can't be tampered with.

Members of local guilds that do business outside the [[G6 - Town|town]] don't entirely trust the Traders' Bank, preferring instead to borrow coin from the Hardcheese family of halfiings that run the Happy Cow tavern. The Alliance officially has no preference, but I find Lady Anteos trustworthy enough to be an alternative to carrying large sums on the road. It's easier to part with a small portion of one's purse than to lose everything to a band of brigands during a journey through the wilds.

Visitors to Daggerford are advised both to avoid the tannery to the west and to swiftly cross Tyndal's Bridge when approaching from the south. The tannery's location, up on the hill, does little to contain the stink of the process, and the Watermen's Guild dumps the city's waste over the side of the bridge. On hot days, the scents exuded from both sites can be overwhelming, which is why I have again asked the Alliance to assign a different agent to visit on next summer's rounds.

Tyndal's Bridge is a low stone structure over which travelers pass when approaching from the west, where a local boy named Tyndal held off a number of lizardfolk with only a dagger. He grew to manhood, married the local ruler's daughter, named himself duke, and built Daggerford atop the ruins of an older castle. This story, and most of the area's history, is happily related to any who ask by Sir Darfin Floshin, an elf older than Daggerford itself. He longs to see a rise in cooperation between humans, dwarves, and elves in the region, such as was once embodied in the realm of Phalorm. Darfin has been advisor to many dukes of Daggerford through the yea.rs. Though he was rebuffed by Duke Maldwyn during his reign, there are signs that Lady Morwen may be more receptive to the advice of a gold elf who has witnessed the fall of the human kingdom of Delimbiyran, the founding of Daggerford, and all the days since.

## Suggested Encounter

If the adventurers hang around [[G6 - Town|town]] or pay a visit to the Happy Cow, the Snail hears about them and sends one of his thugs to request a meeting. The Snail is happy to meet the characters in a public or private place, whichever they prefer. He opens the meeting by putting his offer on the table. If all members of the party sign a written agreement stating that they won't interfere in the Black Network's Daggerford operation or accept any quests or special commissions from Duchess Morwen Daggerford, Nelkin offers them the following benefits:

- Free room and board at the River Shining Tavern and Inn, paid for by the Zhentarim

- One free riding horse or pony for each party member, with stable fees in Daggerford paid for by the Zhentarim

- Ownership of a fortified tower in "fair condition" that overlooks the Delimbiyr River west of [[Orlbar]] (recently abandoned by the Zhentarim after a stone giant attack)

If the Snail can't get the entire party to agree to his terms, he ends the meeting politely, but thereafter he keeps close track of their activities in [[G6 - Town|town]] while doing nothing to antagonize them. He does, however, inform the duchess that the adventurers are in [[G6 - Town|town]] and recommends that she avoid them. Because of her arrangement with the Zhentarim and her fear of being exposed, the succubus posing as Duchess Morwen distances herself from adventurers and denies them an audience.

If the characters check out the fortified tower west of [[Orlbar]], they arrive to find six stone giants dismantling it stone by stone. If the characters kill three or more giants, the rest flee east along the Loagrann River to their lair in Deadstone Cleft (see chapter 6, "Canyon of the Stone Giants"). Repairing the damage to the tower costs 1,000 gp and takes 10 days.
