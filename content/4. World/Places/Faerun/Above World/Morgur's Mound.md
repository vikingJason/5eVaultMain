# Morgur's Mound

## Overview

The spirit mound of the lost Thunderbeast tribe (see the "Uthgardt Barbarians" section earlier in this chapter), Morgur's Mound stands in the [[Crags]] and is named after Uthgar's brother. The mound (see map 3.7) is shaped like a crude, long-necked, wingless dragon-the Uthgardt impression of a thunderbeast. A ridge of dragon bones juts from the head, neck, back, and tail of the mound. Enormous cairns encircle the mound out to a range of a quarter mile. Beneath them lie the bones of revered Thunderbeast tribal warriors.

The Thunderbeast tribe has not visited its spirit mound in years, leaving it ripe for plunderers. Several dig sites left by previous expeditions attest to the mound's popularity among treasure hunters.

## Treasure

Superstitious members of the Thunderbeast tribe buried many magic items in their spirit mound so that they could be watched over by the dead. Looters have unearthed nearly all of these items, leaving little else for intrepid adventurers to find. If the characters mount their own archaeological dig, they might turn up something if they're patient. They can either dig deeper at an existing excavation or start their own hole.

A party member who spends 8 hours excavating beneath Morgur's Mound can make a DC 20 Intelligence 1nvestigation) check. On each successful check, roll once on Magic Item Table B in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine what is found. Only two such treasures can be unearthed. The next party member to succeed on the check finds a giant-sized tooth (see "Ancient Relic"). Once the party finds the relic, further excavations yield nothing of consequence or value.

## Ancient Relic

The character unearths a gold-plated fire giant's tooth, which is an ancient relic of giantkind. The tooth is nonmagical and small enough to fit in the hand of a human.

## Suggested Encounter

When the tooth is lifted from the hole, the ground trembles as four animated thunderbeast skeletons erupt from the mound and fight until turned or destroyed. They focus their attacks on whoever has the fire giant's tooth. Each one has the statistics of an ankylosaurus, with the following changes:

- A thunderbeast skeleton can attack with its bite instead of its tail. Its bite attack has a +7 bonus to hit, has a reach of 5 feet, and deals 18 (`dice: 4d6 + 4`) piercing damage on a hit. Unlike its tail attack, its bite attack can't knock a target prone.

- It has vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.

- It is undead and has immunity to poison damage, the poisoned condition, and exhaustion.

- It has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
