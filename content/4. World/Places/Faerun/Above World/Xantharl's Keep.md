# Xantharl's Keep

## Overview

Xantharl was a well-known ranger and explorer of the North. The fortified village that bears his name stands in the middle of nowhere, on the west side of a notoriously dangerous and rugged stretch of the [[Long Road]]. An outer wall with heavy crossbows mounted to its battlements encloses a keep sheltered by a steep roof to shed snow. Surrounding the keep are dozens of narrow stone houses with heavy shutters and steep roofs of their own. The Falling Ore inn and tavern, a wood-frame structure built on the remains of an older stone building that caught fire and burned down, stands near the main gates next to the stables. The hulking yet friendly proprietor, Arzastra (LG female **half-ogre**), recently took pity on a coinless shield dwarf adventurer named Larg and is paying him a few coppers to clean the stables.

"Larg" told Arzastra that he and his adventuring companions were caught in an avalanche while hunting a red dragon in the [[Valley of Khedrun]], and only he survived. The story is a fabrication, but Arzastra bought it. The shifty dwarf is actually a wanted criminal named Worvil "the Weevil" Forkbeard. The characters might know of him from talking to certain NPCs (such as Sir Barie Nylef in [[Bryn Shander]] or Darz Helgar in [[Triboar]]), or from a wanted poster in [[Longsaddle]]. The Weevil can be found cleaning the inn's stables during the day or drinking in a private, plainly furnished guest bedroom on the upper floor of the inn at night. The Weevil avoids making eye contact with strangers. He has the statistics of a **bandit captain** with the following changes:

- The Weevil is neutral evil.

- His speed is 25 feet.

- He has advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage.

- He has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, and he speaks Common, Draconic, and Dwarvish.

- Instead of a scimitar and a dagger, he wields a pair of +l handaxes (+5 to hit with each). As an action, he can make three melee attacks, two attacks with one handaxe and one attack with the other handaxe. Each handaxe deals 6 (ld6 + 3) slashing damage on a hit.

The Lord of Xantharl's Keep is Narbeck Horn (N male shield dwarf **knight** armed with a greataxe instead of a greatsword), who reports to the marchion of [[Mirabar]]. Narbeck has a sending stone that allows him to speak to the marchion directly, ensuring that news of any threat to [[Mirabar]] from the south is quickly relayed. Narbeck commands a garrison of one hundred fifty veterans, which is over twice the population of the village itself.

## Suggested Encounter

Guards on the rooftop of the keep spot a **frost giant** approaching from the west with a small army of fifty **goblins** and ten **hobgoblins**, plus five **ogres** equipped with goblin huckers (see the "Goblin Huckers" section in chapter 2). The hobgoblins form a phalanx in the front of the group, with the frost giant behind them and the unruly mob of ogres and goblins bringing up the rear.

Even without the characters' help, the keep can turn back the attackers with few casualties. (Many goblins are killed as their bodies are flung against the keep by the huckers.) During the uproar, any character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check realizes that the siege is a ruse to draw attention away from the village's east gate, where the real attack is taking place.

A while back, Worvil Forkbeard told a few friends that he needed a place to hide and planned to lie low in Xantharl's Keep. One of his friends betrayed that confidence to the frost giant now attacking the keep, who is named Kaltivar. The giant intends to collect on the 5,000 gp reward being offered for the dwarf's capture and is using the goblinoids and ogres as a distraction to help him bag the dwarf. While the garrison is occupied on the west side of [[G6 - Town|town]], ten stealthy **bugbears** climb over the eastern wall and attempt to capture Worvil. If the characters already have the dwarf in custody, the bugbears try to take Worvil from them. If Worvil is dead and the bugbears see his corpse, they immediately try to flee the keep and report back to Kaltivar. Characters who are unaware of the Weevil's presence or his true identity can hear the dwarf and bugbears fighting in the stables with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, and the Weevil manages to kill a couple of bugbears before he's dragged off in a sack.

## Treasure

Kaltivar the frost giant carries a sack containing `dice: 2d6` x 100 gp, ld4 mundane items (determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction), and one magic item, determined by rolling on Magic Item Table C in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The goblinoids have no treasure.
