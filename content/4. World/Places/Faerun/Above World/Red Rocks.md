# Red Rocks
## Overview
Off the coast lies a collection of tiny islets known collectively as the Red Rocks. Most of these landforms are sea stacks carved by the waves of the Sea of Swords, but some are little more than boulders peeking up above the waves. The Red Rocks have sunk countless ships over the centuries, so sailors tend to give the area a wide berth. Fishers in small vessels frequent these waters, however, since the area is home to a huge variety of fish and shellfish, many of which are prized in Waterdeep.
