# Zymorven Hall
## Overview
Perched atop a crag overlooking the [[Rauvin Road]], with a clear view of the [[Evermoors]] to the south and the [[Moonwood]] to the north, is a keep of mortared stone with a high-pitched roof that has wooden statues of baying wolves rising from its peaks. A branch in the road winds up to the keep's gatehouse and bailey. From the keep, the Zymorven family of Silverymoon has watched over the surrounding lands for four generations.

Lord Harthos Zymorven (CG male Chondathan human **knight**) commands Zymorven Hall, which appears to have no guards to defend it. Many of the hallways and rooms, however, have suits of armor standing in dark corners, swords mounted on oak-paneled walls, and dusty carpets spread across stone floors. These are actually suits of **animated armor**, **flying sword's**, and **rugs of smothering** that obey Lord Zymorven's commands. Lord Zymorven retains the services of a scribe, a stablehand, a cook, and a musician (all **commoners**), as well as an old witch (use the **druid** statistics) who is skilled at making herbal remedies and poultices.

Lord Zymorven's duty is to be vigilant and watch for trouble, which could come from any direction. Soldiers patrolling the [[Rauvin Road]] on horseback are welcome to use the keep as a place where they can rest as well as obtain food, drink, and lodging for their horses. Characters who take up Urgala Meltimer's quest (see chapter 2) might have cause to pay a visit to Zymorven Hall.
