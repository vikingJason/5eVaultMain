# Iron Trail
## Overview
An overland route called the Iron Trail connects [[Ironmaster]] to the [[Ten Trail]], but it virtually disappears in the winter, buried under snow. It crosses wind-blasted hills and tundra, offering precious little shelter. Characters traveling the Iron Trail in wintertime are subject to extreme cold temperatures (see the "Wilderness Survival" section in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).
