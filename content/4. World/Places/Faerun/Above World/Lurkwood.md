# Lurkwood
## Overview
The southern verge of the Lurkwood is safe enough to attract woodcutters, trappers, and hunters from [[Mirabar]], [[Xantharl's Keep]], and [[Longsaddle]], but there's really no corner safe from the Uthgardt tribes that hunt here (primarily Black Raven and Thunderbeast barbarians). Goblinoids, wolves, and dire wolves also prowl these woods.
