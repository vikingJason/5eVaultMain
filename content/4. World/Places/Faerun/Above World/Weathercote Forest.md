# Weathercote Forest
## Overview
For reasons unknown, no divination spell or scrying sensor can penetrate the dry patch of greenery on the edge of the [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] desert. Woodcutters from [[Parnast]] warn adventurers not to enter too deeply into Weathercote Forest, as ancient elven magic has a way of making people disappear forever.
