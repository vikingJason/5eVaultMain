The spirit mound of the Great Worm tribe of Uthgardt barbarians is inside a spacious cavern at the northeast end of the [[Valley of Khedrun]], deep in the [[Spine of the World]]. Thick ice hangs above the pillared entrance to Great Worm Cavern, and the interior walls of the place are covered with an icy glaze and lined with massive icicles that gleam and glitter in reflected light. The walls are too slippery to be climbed without gear or magic. The cavern floor is a sheet of slippery ice (see the "Wilderness Hazards" section in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) flanked by 70-foot-high ledges of rock, atop which stand two totem poles of chiseled ice with carvings that resemble winged snakes. The walls of these ledges are riddled with caves in which the Great Worm tribe members live. Natural steam vents in the rock keep the caves warm throughout the year. Above the ledges, dug into the cavern walls, are narrow crypts where the honored dead are placed, their frozen corpses propped up in a standing position.

## Altar
Rising from the back of the cavern is a triangular promontory of ice-covered rock, 120 feet above the cavern floor at its peak. Thereupon stands an altar of frost-covered stone, carved in the shape of a coiled serpent with great wings. The altar represents Elrem, the Great Worm. Here, the tribal warriors make sacrifices to the Great Worm in honor of Uthgar. Doing so, they believe, ensures that Elrem doesn't return to devour them.

Bound inside the altar is a **couatl**. It can phase into and out of the altar at will. While inside the altar, the couatl is undetectable and can sense creatures within 120 feet of it. The first time a good-hearted character approaches within 20 feet of the altar, the couatl telepathically reaches out to that character without divulging its location or identity. Communicating in a language that the character understands, the couatl warns the character that the Great Worm tribe has fallen under the sway of an evil chieftain named Wormblod. It asks the character to hunt down and slay Womblod, promising a reward for this good deed. The couatl knows that Wormblod is away, searching for a missing concubine named If the characters present proof ofWormblod's death as an offering to the altar, see "Development."

If anyone damages the altar, the couatl emerges and tries to frighten them off, attacking only as a last resort.

## Ancient Relic
At the back of the cave hangs a relic of giantkind: a crescent- shaped gong in a crude stone frame. The gong, a circular disk 13 feet in diameter, was once the shield of a frost giant champion, but it was broken in combat and is now missing a large piece. What remains of it weighs 250 pounds. The shield is made of red dragon scales bolted to a beaten copper frame. Its leather arm straps are long gone. The ropes holding up the gong can be cut with two swings of a sword.

If the gong is struck inside the cavern, its deep tone echoes throughout the cavern and causes a few large icicles to break away from the ceiling and crash down onto the icy floor. The crashing ice awakens three **young remorhazes** hibernating in a cyst beneath the ice. The remorhazes burst up through the ice and attack any creatures they see. The Great Worm tribesfolk are unaware of the remorhazes and have no way to control them once they burst forth.

## Suggested Encounter
Most Great Worm tribe members are nomads who hunt and forage in the wilderness. Those who dwell here are typically the elderly, mothers, and children. Each small cave at the base of the cavern holds `dice: 1d4+4` noncombatants, and standing atop the ledges, watching the entrance, are four **tribal warriors** (two per ledge). They have a stack of spears to hurl down at intruders.

## Treasure
The remorhaz lair can be explored and plundered if the creatures are killed. The area is a 20-foot-diameter oval chamber with walls of glazed ice. Scattered on the floor are three 500 gp gemstones, fifteen 100 gp gemstones, and one magic item determined by rolling on Magic Item Table C in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If the characters slay Wormblod and bring proof of his demise, the couatl emerges from the altar and bestows on each of them a charm of restoration (see the "Supernatural Gifts" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). The couatl then returns to the altar and makes no further attempt to communicate with them.
