# Calling Horns
## Overview
Calling Horns was nothing more than a trailside inn until a few years ago, when Tamalin Zoar (N female Tethyrian human noble) bought the establishment and retired here. Using her hard-won wealth and influence, she attracted settlers to the region, giving rise to a small village whose citizens pay monthly "tithes" for Tamalin's protection. Still spry at sixty, Tamalin is "the law" in Calling Horns-an irony that never ceases to amuse her. She employs nine deputies (N male and female veterans of various races) who live in the village proper to help keep the peace. Tamalin also gives free room and board to adventurers who help solve local problems. Given the village's proximity to the [[Evermoors]], few villagers have cause to complain about Tamalin's protection racket. She keeps them safe from ores, trolls, and other monsters, and that's good enough for them.

Calling Horns stands where [[Jundar's Pass]] meets up with the Evermoor Way. The intersection is marked by a cairn of weathered and lichen-covered ore skulls that commemorates the long-ago slaughter of a horde here. The village proper is made up of rows of small log cottages with bark-shingled rooftops. The Calling Horns Inn, a large fieldstone structure with adjoining [[Stables|stables]], stands atop a ridge that overlooks the intersection, surrounded by tall, old trees. The inn's cellar contains an impressive selection of ales and wines, as well as a secret tunnel that leads to a hidden exit in the hillside.

## Suggested Encounter
As fire giants scour the [[Evermoors]] for fragments of the Vonindod, trolls native to the area are fleeing to avoid becoming enslaved by the giants. If the characters stay at the Calling Horns Inn for a night, they and Tamalin are awakened in the wee hours by a strange racket. Two trolls are trying to claw their way into the inn's stable to feast on the horses inside. The trolls are hungry and fight to the death. Once the trolls are dealt with, Tamalin reveals to the characters that troll attacks are becoming more common, and she offers to give the adventurers a letter of recommendation (see the "Marks of Prestige" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide) if they find the root cause. Tamalin tells them that her letter can win them a powerful friend in [[Everlund]] if they show it to the half-ore innkeeper at Danivarr's House (see the "[[Everlund]]" section), or it can be given to a member of the Hand of Yartar ([[Yartar]]'s thieves' guild) in exchange for a special favor.

If the characters take up Tamalin's quest and they spend at least two nights in the [[Evermoors]], they witness a female fire giant slapping around a troll shortly before highsun on the third day. The fire giant, Zaastrid, carries a rod of the Vonindod (see appendix B). Zaastrid is hungry and upset that her enslaved troll has found nothing to eat. The characters can choose to keep their distance and avoid conflict, or they can engage the ravenous fire giant and her troll in battle. Zaastrid and the troll fight to the death. If the characters return to Calling Horns and report their fire giant sighting to Tamalin, she is satisfied and gives them her letter.
