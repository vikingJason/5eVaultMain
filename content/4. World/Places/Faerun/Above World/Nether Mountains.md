# Nether Mountains
## Overview
The dark, brooding peaks of the Nether Mountains are the source of many legends about lost Netherese magic, as well as a repository of tangible riches such as granite. The mountains are also full of tribes of ores, while the eastern peaks are home to several blue dragons that were chased out of the northern [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] desert by lymrith and her brood (see the "[[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]]" section).
