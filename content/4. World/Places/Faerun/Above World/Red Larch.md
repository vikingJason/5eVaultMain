# Red Larch
## Overview
Named for a distinctive stand of red larch trees that were cut down when the village was founded, Red Larch is situated on a fertile patch of land on the western outskirts of the [[Sumber Hills]], at a place where the [[Kheldell Path]] and the [[Cairn Road]] meet the [[Long Road]]. Despite its small size, Red Larch offers many fine amenities, including the Allfaiths Shrine, a place of worship that caters to multiple faiths; the Swinging Sword, a respectable three-story stone inn with a high-pitched roof; and the Helm at Highsun, a ramshackle yet lively tavern. A map of Red Larch and a detailed description of the village and its inhabitants can be found in the adventure Princes of the Apocalypse.
