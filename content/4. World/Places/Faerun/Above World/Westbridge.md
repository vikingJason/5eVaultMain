# Westbridge
## Overview
A village strung out along the [[Long Road]] between [[Red Larch]] and [[Triboar]], Westbridge (so named because it lies to the west of the [[Stone Bridge]]) is home to the Harvest Inn, on the west side of the [[Long Road]] facing the [[Stone Trail]]. The inn's proprietor is the affable Herivin Dardragon (CG male strongheart halfling commoner), a curly-haired collector and reseller of paintings and statuettes of questionable taste.
