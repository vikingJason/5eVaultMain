# Yartar

## Overview

The fortified city of Yartar stands on the east bank of the Dessarin River. On the west bank is a walled citadel under the city's control. Between them stretches a wide [[Stone Bridge|stone bridge]]. Travelers must move through the citadel and pass inspection before continuing west to [[Triboar]] or crossing the bridge to the city's west gate. The [[Evermoor Way]] cuts through the heart ofYartar, connecting the city's western and eastern gates. East of the city, the trade road becomes a gravel trail.

Yartar is prosperous and becoming increasingly crowded. Some of its old buildings have been torn down and taller ones built-four stories high, in some cases.

Because the city is a major river port, Yartar's elected leader is called a Waterbaron. The current Waterbaron is Nestra Ruthiol (LE female Tethyrian human **noble**), a shrewd, vindictive woman in her late fifties. Yartar is a member of the Lords' Alliance, and Ruthiol considers that relationship vital to her city's survival and prosper 􀅛- She knows that the Harpers and the Zhentarim are well established in the city, but her path crosses with theirs only when the well-being ofYartarrans is threatened. Both factions have infiltrated the local thieves' IUild, the all-female Hand ofYartar.

Characters who obtain Tamalin Zoar's letter of recommendation (see the "[[Calling Horns]]" section) can present · to a member of the Hand of Yartar and gain the guild's assistance in any of the following ways:

- If the characters are looking for an individual in the city whose location isn't well known, the Hand ofYartar can reliably track down that person in `dice: 4d6` hours .

- If the characters need to sell loot, the Hand ofYartar can find (not necessarily honest) buyers for them.

- If the characters come to Yartar seeking an expeditious means of travel, the Hand of Yartar tells them about a not-so-secret teleportation circle guarded by a wizard named Kolbaz (see the "Inner Circles" section at the end of this chapter).

The greatest threat facing Yartar is the Kraken Society (see the "Factions in the North" section in the introduction), which is trying to seize control of the city from within and turn it into a stronghold. One ofYartar's nobles is a Kraken Society member named Khaspere Drylund. Lord Drylund is eager to displace Ruthiol as the city's Waterbaron. He can't have Ruthiol eliminated, however, until he has gathered enough support to guarantee victory in the election to determine her successor. He hopes to win votes by identifying and bribing (or blackmailing) Yartar's most corruptible officials, and by hosting extravagant parties aboard his private, splendidly decorated riverboat. For more information on Lord Drylund and his boat, see chapter 11.
