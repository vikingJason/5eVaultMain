# Raven Rock
## Overview
On the icy slopes of the [[Spine of the World]] stands the spirit mound of the Black Raven and Gray Wolf tribes of Uthgardt barbarians. Raven Rock gets its name from a 100-foot-tall stone carved in the likeness of a perching raven, sitting in the center of the highest plateau of the mound and facing west. The Black Ravens leave carcasses by the stone raven's feet as offerings. At dusk, giant ravens gather to feast on the remains. After devouring the carrion, the giant ravens perch on timber roosts and squawk at one another until nightfall, when they fly off. Warriors of the Black Raven tribe sometimes ride these giant ravens into battle.

Surrounding Raven Rock are four 50-foot-tall menhirs that the Uthgardt shamans use to track the changing of the seasons and the movement of the stars.

The Gray Wolves aren't allowed atop the high plateau. Instead, they gather around an altar mound in the heart of a wolf-shaped depression southwest of Raven Rock. Their altar is a rectangular slab of stone with the phases of the moon carved into its sides.

In winter, everything is under a foot or more of snow.

## Ancient Relics
Two ancient giant relics are buried here-one in the ground before the giant stone raven, and another under the Gray Wolves' altar. Uthgar's early followers planted these objects here to empower and ward their spirit mound. A detect magic spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic emanating from the ground in front of the giant stone raven, and an aura of transmutation magic from underneath the altar. The ground in both locations as frozen solid year-round.

Without the aid of magic, it takes 5 hours for one character to dig up the relic hidden in the ground by the giant stone raven; reduce the amount of time proportionately if other party members help. The relic is a ring of hardened magma sized for a fire giant's finger. When a creature attunes to the ring, it magically shrinks to fit that creature's index finger, and warm orange light spills from minuscule cracks that form on its outer surface. The ring has 6 charges left. While attuned to the ring, a creature can expend 1 charge to cast conjure minor elementals (summoning either four **magma mephits** or four **magmins**, as the wearer wishes) or fire shield warm shield version only) from the ring. Once all of its charges are spent, the ring loses its spellcasting properties but retains its resizing property.

To reach the relic buried under the Gray Wolves' altar, the characters must smash through the altar or burrow underneath it. One character can accomplish either task in 10 hours; reduce the amount of time proportionately if other party members help. The buried relic is a 14-foot-long, 250-pound red dragon's thighbone. Part of the bone is wrapped in old leather, suggesting that it was once used as a giant's greatclub. If a creature attunes to the greatclub, it magically shrinks to a size that the creature can wield effectively. The greatclub is considered a magic weapon that deals an extra `dice: 2d8` bludgeoning damage whenever it hits a dragon (including any creature of the dragon type).

## Suggested Encounter (Day)
If the characters arrive at Raven Rock in the morning or the afternoon, they see `dice: 2d4` giant ravens (use the **giant vulture** statistics) flying lazy circles at a height of 300 feet above the spirit mound. If the characters arrive in the evening, the giant ravens are perched quietly on their wooden roosts. The ravens aren't present at night. The giant ravens don't attack intruders or squawk at them, but they remember with perfect clarity any trespassers they see and describe them to the next group of Black Raven barbarians they meet.

If the giant ravens see the characters take the magma ring, the Black Raven barbarians learn about the theft `dice: 1d4` days later. After that time, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the Black Ravens locate the characters (or a subset of them, if the party splits up). Alternatively, you can have them catch up to the party at a dramatic moment of your choice. Wherever the characters happen to be, an **Uthgardt shaman** (see appendix C) and six **tribal warriors** , each mounted on a giant raven, attack the characters. Rules for mounted combat appear in chapter 9 of the Player's Handbook.

## Suggested Encounter (Night)
Characters who explore Raven Rock in the dead of night encounter `dice: 2d4` **wolves** and `dice: 1d4+1` **werewolves** in wolf form. The wer ewolves are members of the Gray Wolf tribe.
