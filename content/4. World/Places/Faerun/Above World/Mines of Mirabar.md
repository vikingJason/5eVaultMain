# Mines of Mirabar
## Overview
The rugged land around [[Mirabar]] is littered with mine heads, open quarries, and heaps of slag and rubble. The mines of [[Mirabar]] yield up vast quantities of most known metals and gemstones. Working mines of any significance are heavily fortified. All miners who enter-dwarf and human-are searched both before and after shifts, ensuring security. It is an inconvenience the miners accept because, unlike many other places in the North, [[Mirabar]] pays well and cares for the workers.
