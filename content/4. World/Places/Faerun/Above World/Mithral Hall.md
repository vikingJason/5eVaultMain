# Mithral Hall
## Overview
The ancestral home of the Battlehammer clan of shield dwarves is a nigh-impregnable vault beneath the [[Frost Hills]], with massive granite doors sealing its entrance and a host of battle-hardened defenders waiting beyond. Despite its almost mythic reputation, Mithral Hall is more of a stronghold than a city, with tunnels to other dwarfholds hidden deep below its mines.

Bruenor Battlehammer gave up the title of King of Mithra! Hall for the third and final time when he set out to reclaim the lost dwarven city of [[Gauntlgrym]]. His handpicked successor, Dagnabbet Waybeard, now rules Mithra! Hall as queen. A bold leader and a fierce warrior, Queen Dagnabbet firmly supports Mithra! Hall's membership in the Lords' Alliance.
