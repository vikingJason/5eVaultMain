# Dessarin Valley
## Overview
The lowlands on either side of the Dessarin River constitute the Dessarin Valley, a vast tract of fertile land stretching north from Waterdeep to the [[Surbrin Hills]]. The [[Long Road]] hugs the west border of the valley, which is hemmed in on the east by the [[High Forest]] and the [[Forlorn Hills]]. The valley is dotted with settlements, farms, and isolated homesteads, yet most of it is unsettled. The valley's primary trade route is the river itself.
