# Misty Forest
## Overview
This evergreen forest gets its name from the fog that creeps down from the [[High Moor]] and enshrouds it, making navigation difficult on even the best of days. The forest is patrolled by wood elves, who defend the woods from poachers. Visitors who leave the inhabitants of the Misty Forest alone, and who build their campfires small and solely of fallen branches, are usually not disturbed.
