# Carnath Roadhouse
## Overview
This walled compound served as a hostelry on the [[High Road]] between [[Waterdeep]] and Neverwinter in the days when trade between the two cities flourished. It fell into disuse when that trade stopped after the eruption of Mount Hotenow (see the "Neverwinter" section). Now that Neverwinter has recovered and commerce has resumed, the road has been rebuilt and the roadhouse repaired and put to use as a supply depot and wagon park. It stands on the west side of the road, a stone's throw from the edge of the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. Fog drifting off the mere engulfs the roadhouse at night and lingers well into the following afternoon. The sounds of the marsh, from croaking frogs to buzzing insects, are only somewhat dampened by the roadhouse's walls and doors.

The superintendent of the Carnath Roadhouse is a brusque but well-educated half-ore named Bog Luck (N male half-ore veteran). Accustomed to doing business with shady traders and contraband, he doesn't trouble his clients with too many questions. He simply takes their money while assuring them that the gates and walls of the roadhouse are strong enough to hold back any threat. Bog Luck employs four stable boys and a cook named Gristle Pete (N male Tethyrian human commoners), though he doesn't pay them much.

The Carnath Roadhouse figures prominently in Hoard of the Dragon Queen. That adventure also includes a map of the roadhouse. Bandits and monsters lurk near the road both north and south of the roadhouse.
