# Trade Way
## Overview
The Trade Way begins at Waterdeep and heads southward, though only the stretch between Waterdeep and [[Daggerford]] is well traveled. Merchants who can't afford to transport their goods by ship use the Trade Way, hiring guards to fend off the brigands and monsters that live in the surrounding wilderness.
