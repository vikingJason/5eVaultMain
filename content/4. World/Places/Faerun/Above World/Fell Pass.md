# Fell Pass
## Overview
Between the northernmost rampart of the [[Frost Hills]] and the [[Spine of the World]] lies a high, cold pass that links the [[Lurkwood]] to the Surbrin River. Tribes of Uthgardt barbarians hunt the Fell Pass, occasionally clashing with other Uthgardt over contested territory.
