# Far Forest
## Overview
Named for its remoteness, the woodland expanse between [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] and [[Delimbiyr Vale]] is home to tribes of sprites, lonely dryads, irksome satyrs, and territorial centaurs. Owlbears also prowl the Far Forest in alarming numbers, while the darkest depths are home to frightful ettercaps and their giant spider pets.
