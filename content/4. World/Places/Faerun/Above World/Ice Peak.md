# Ice Peak
## Overview
The frozen island that lies southeast of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] is named for the snow-capped promontory that dominates its northern half. Most of the inhabitants live in a few settlements clustered around the twin bays on the southern shore. Caves in the mountain's peak serve as a lair for Arveiaturace, the white wyrm known to sailors as Iceclaws because of her habit of diving on hapless vessels and tearing them apart with her talons.

Longships crowd the docks of [[Aurilsbarg]], the island's largest community. Typical of the settlements on Ice Peak, the streets of [[Aurilsbarg]] are paved with logs laid side by side, and its buildings are low wooden structures whose pitched roofs are covered in sod. The heart of [[Aurilsbarg]] is Green Hall, a spacious tavern with a lengthy firepit that can spit six goats at a time to feed the cold and hungry crews that arrive after unloading their ships at the docks. Locals come here as well to hear the latest news from the mainland, although by the time it reaches Ice Peak, such news is often out of date and wildly exaggerated, little better than idle rumor. Still, the isolated inhabitants of [[Aurilsbarg]] eat it up all the same.

The island's smaller coastal settlements include the fishing and trapping villages of Bjorn's Hold and Icewolf. The natives of Ice Peak survive by catching fish and hunting goats, seals, and whales. The island boasts a large yeti population. They feed on mountain goats, avoiding Northlanders unless food is scarce.
