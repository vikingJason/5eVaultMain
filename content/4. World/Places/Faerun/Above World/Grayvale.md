# Grayvale
## Overview
Nestled in the southern part of the [[Graypeak Mountains]], a beautiful and fertile valley stands between the settlements of [[Loudwater]] and [[Llorkh]]. The Grayflow River flows through the middle of Grayvale, which is dotted with farmsteads, hunting lodges, old dwarven mines, and the ruins of bygone elven kingdoms. Now, many of Grayvale's homesteads and hamlets lie in ruins, after recently being flattened by rampaging stone giants. The vale has been mostly evacuated, except for a few scattered farms whose inhabitants refuse to leave.

## Suggested Encounter
As the characters explore Grayvale, a **young brass dragon** named Silixia spots them from a nearby hilltop. The friendly dragon offers greetings and warns the party that stone giants are laying waste to farms, homesteads, and ruins throughout Grayvale. She has spent the past few weeks helping farmers and other locals flee the vale. She doesn't know why the normally reclusive giants are suddenly out to destroy everything. If the characters ask Silixia where the stone giants live, she offers to lead them to [[Deadstone Cleft]] and warns them that the giants have a roe "pet" that guards the entrance to their canyon lair. Silixia has no interest in battling the giants, but she can be bribed into luring away the roe or providing some other form of assistance. A rare magic item or a collection of gems worth at least 5,000 gp is enough to satisfy her. A character who barters with the dragon can, with a successful DC 17 Charisma (Persuasion) check, convince Silixia to accept an uncommon magic item or 2,500 gp as payment.
