# Iron Road
## Overview
Once a prominent thoroughfare built by the dwarves of Besilmer, the Iron Road remains one of the few visible relics of that bygone kingdom. Most of its stones have been stolen or buried under grass, weeds, and earth. Today, the Iron Road is nothing more than a wagon trail with small patches of interlocking stones here and there. The route begins a few miles east ofWomford and hugs the northern edge of the [[Forlorn Hills]] as it travels southeast through [[Uluvin]], crosses the [[Delimbiyr Vale]], and ends at the [[G6 - Town|town]] of [[Secomber]]. Dwarves in [[Secomber]] claim that their ancestors used the Iron Road to transport iron ore from the [[Forlorn Hills]] to forges in various outlying settlements-hence the road's name.
