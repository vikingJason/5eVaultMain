# Citadel Felbarr

## Overview

This formidable dwarven fortress-city lies beneath the [[Rauvin Mountains]]. To enter the place, one must traverse an elevated road, with 100-foot-high cliffs on both sides, and pass through two enormous gates called the Hammer and the Anvil. Two wide parapets with crenellated battlements called North Vigil and South Vigil stand outside these gates on the nearby mountainsides, ready to rain ballista bolts and catapult stones down on would-be invaders. The road ends at the Runegate, the main entrance to the underground city. Deep beneath the mountains are tunnels connecting to Felbarr's mines, [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]], and the distant dwarven bastions of Mithra! Hall and [[Citadel Adbar]].

Citadel Felbarr has fallen to orcs twice in its long history, only to be reclaimed and rebuilt by the dwarves each time. Felbarr's great hero-king, Emerus Warcrown, who restored Felbarr to its former glory during the War of the [[Silver Marches]], died shortly after the war while helping his fellow dwarves reclaim the lost city of [[Gauntlgrym]]. Since Emerus's death, leadership of the Felbarren dwarves has fallen to Emerus's distant kin, King Morinn and Queen Tithmel. The two monarchs rule wisely as equals.

## Suggested Encounter

The king and the queen have received disturbing reports of fire giant sightings in the hills to the northwest. They fear that the giants might be in the process of reigniting the ancient underground forge known as lronslag. If the adventurers visit Citadel Felbarr, the sovereigns learn of their arrival and summon them to their throne hall for an audience. King Morinn and Queen Tithmel tell the characters about their suspicions concerning [[Ironslag]] and ask them to investigate. In return, they offer to build the heroes a fortified tower. It would be erected on a large estate in the [[Silver Marches]] (exact location determined by you). The tower takes one hundred days to build, and the dwarf sovereigns vow to cover the construction costs. To earn this reward, the characters must go to [[Ironslag]] and return to Felbarr with proof that the fire giants are no longer a threat. (Duke Zalto's head or the word of freed dwarven prisoners will do.)

If the characters take care of Duke Zalto (see chapter 8, "Forge of the Fire Giants"), King Morinn and Queen Tithmel honor their pledge to build the party a tower stronghold. On top of that, they offer to supply a garrison of ten stalwart, unfailingly loyal Felbarren dwarves. Use the guard statistics, with the following changes:

- The shield dwarves are lawful good.

- They have a walking speed of 25 feet.

- They have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

- They have advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage.

- They speak Common and Dwarvish.
