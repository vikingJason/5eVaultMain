# Eye of the All-Father
## Overview
Built by giants long ago, this temple dedicated to Annam the All-Father lies hidden under the [[Spine of the World]]. A snow-covered pass that begins in the [[Valley of Khedrun]] leads to the temple. See chapter 4, "The Chosen Path," for more information on this location.
