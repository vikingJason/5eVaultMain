# Everlund

## Overview

### Map

Situated on the banks of the Rauvin River, Everlund is one of the North's most active mercantile communities. A thick stone wall encloses the city, pierced in five places by gates. Like the spokes of a wheel, broad, straight avenues lead from each gate to the Bell Market at the city's center. The streets are clean and wide enough to accommodate large caravan vehicles. Soldiers of the city's army make a show of patrolling the walls, to reassure citizens and visitors as well as to discourage attackers. The buildings of Everlund are stately and well maintained, with steeply pitched rooftops and tall spires that sport colorful banners. Two bridges span the river, which has parks and trees along its shores.

Until recently, Everlund was a member of the Lords' Alliance. The five leaders who currently comprise the city's Council of Elders voted three to two in favor of separation and, in a symbolic show of support for [[Sundabar]] (see the "[[Sundabar]]" section), condemned the alliance for its failure to come to [[Sundabar]]'s aid during the War of the [[Silver Marches]]. The decision was touted as an opportunity for Everlund to chart its own course, but more educated citizens believe the vote was orchestrated by the Zoar family, a group of influential nobles that moved to Everlund from Waterdeep over a century ago amid some scandal. The Zoars have gained considerable political influence in Everlund, to the extent that they now have a representative on the Council of Elders.

The Hall of the Elders is where the council meets to discuss issues affecting the city. Only the councilors know who voted which way concerning the decision to leave the Lords' Alliance. The members of the Council of Elders are as follows:

- High Captain Horix Zoar (LN male Tethyrian human noble), commander of Everlund's army and a windbag

- High Sorcerer Vaeril Rhuidhen (NG male sun elf archmage), a quiet voice of moderation and reason who keeps the peace between the council's more fractious members (and who formerly served as liaison to the Lords' Alliance)

- The Keeper of the Bridges, Kythora Shen (LN female Shou human veteran), a retired soldier and skilled bureaucrat charged with overseeing the city watch and the conduct of commerce in the city

- The Master of Guilds, Boldor Steelshield (N male shield dwarf noble), representing the merchants of Everlund, who is prone to hyperbole and rumored to accept bribes

- The Speaker of the [[G6 - Town|Town]], a citizen elected every seven years to represent the common folk in the city; currently the post is held by Vatrice Stormwright (CG female Illuskan human commoner), an easily flustered woman who owns a modestly successful chimney-sweeping business in the city.

The most prominent edifice in Everlund is Moongleam Tower, a keep of black stone that serves as a Harper stronghold in the North. It rises from one of the higher knolls in the city and consists of four narrow, cylindrical towers joined together, surrounded by a dry moat that can be quickly flooded through a system of cisterns and pumps. Crowning the roof is an open turret, where a signaling mirror shaped like a crescent moon stands.

At any time, from five to fifteen Harpers are in residence, attended by a loyal staff and a private garrison of twenty veterans. Moon lord Daviana Yalrannis (CG female Tethyrian human knight) is the master of the tower, charged with its defense and upkeep. A powerful Harper wizard named Krowen Valharrow (CG male Turami human archmage with a robe of useful items and a staff of fire) also resides in the tower, along with dozens of domesticated tressym (see appendix C) and a handful of apprentice mages. Apart from their ability to fly, the tressym behave like normal house cats. If one or more characters show an interest in the tressym, Krowen offers to bequeath one ( but no more than one) to the party. The tressym bonds with the first character to earn its trust, which requires some obvious sign of affection accompanied by a successful DC 17 Charisma check. A character with proficiency in the Animal Handling skill has advantage on the check. The bonded tressym obeys that character's commands and no one else's.

Near the top of Moongleam Tower is a circular, windowless room that contains a permanent teleportation circle, which high-ranking Harpers use to enter and leave the tower unseen (see the "Inner Circles" section at the end of this chapter).

The city boasts many temples, the most prominent of which are dedicated to Helm, Mielikki, and Corellon Larethian. Everlund also has many fine places to eat and rest, the oldest and largest being Danivarr's House. Once a noble's mansion, this rambling inn is a favorite haunt for adventurers. The Zoar family bought the establishment a few years ago, but leaves the running of Danivarr's House to a one-eyed half-ore named Oral Thelev (LG male half-ore commoner). Both the Harpers and the Zhentarim keep a close eye on this place.

## Development

If the characters received a letter of recommendation from Tamalin Zoar (see the "[[Calling Horns]]" section) and they show it to Dral Thelev, the half-ore tells them that the Zoar family has power in the city and that the characters can give the letter of recommendation to Dral in exchange for one favor from the Zoars (see the "Marks of Prestige" section in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). When the characters decide to ca11 in the favor, Dral contacts his employers, and High Captain Horix Zoar does everything in his power to give the characters what they want, provided it's within his power and isn't likely to burden him or the Zoar family. Examples of what he might provide include a meeting with one or more members of the Council of Elders, an arranged meeting with a Lords' Alliance representative from another city, and a spell scroll of raise dead.
