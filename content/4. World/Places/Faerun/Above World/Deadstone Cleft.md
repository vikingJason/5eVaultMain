# Deadstone Cleft
## Overview
A misty canyon in the [[Graypeak Mountains]] called Deadstone Cleft is home to a clan of stone giants under the influence of Thane Kayalithica, a devout but misguided worshiper of Skoraeus Stonebones. See chapter 6, "Canyon of the Stone Giants," for more information on this location.
