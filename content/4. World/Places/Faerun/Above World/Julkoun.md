# Julkoun
## Overview
A motte-and-bailey village calledJulkoun marks the west end of the old [[Delimbiyr Road]] and rests on the north shore of the Delimbiyr River (which locals call "the River Shining"). A moat surrounds the village, which is further enclosed by wooden palisades. A few burned cottages stand outside, their blackened remains a testament to the bandits and other perils that haunt the nearby wilderness. Visitors are welcome at the Jester's Pride tavern, which serves robust dwarven ale.
