# Silver Marches
## Overview
Also known as Luruar, this region of the North is hemmed in by the Ice Spires to the north, the Rauvin River to the south, the [[Frost Hills]] to the west, and the desert of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Anauroch]] to the east. Mineral-rich mountain ranges, beautiful alpine slopes and valleys, and fertile farmland make the Silver Marches a tempting place to live. At the same time, monsters abound here. Ores and giants inhabit the mountains, Uthgardt barbarians haunt the northern forests, and the drow city of [[Menzoberranzan]] lies in [[2 - The Underdark|the Underdark]] below. Dragons also assault farms and settlements from time to time.

The War of the Silver Marches exacted such a heavy toll-including the destruction and occupation of [[Sundabar]]- that the final victory over the ores felt hollow. One can't help but notice the corpse-strewn battlefields, ravaged homesteads, and maimed soldiers and citizens that are lasting reminders of the ores' savagery.
