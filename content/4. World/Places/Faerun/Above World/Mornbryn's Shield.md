# Mornbryn's Shield
## Overview
Mornbryn's Shield, a village on the western fringe of the [[Evermoors]], takes its name from the rocky, horseshoe ridge that forms a natural rampart along the west and south sides of the settlement, protecting it against flooding when the Surbrin River swells in the spring. At the northeast end of Mornbryn's Shield is a small stone keep with fire-hurling catapults aimed toward the [[Evermoors]]. Mornbryn was a ranger of some fame in the North centuries ago, and legend has it that his treasure- filled tomb is hidden somewhere close by.

The villagers are accustomed to facing threats from the [[Evermoors]], but nothing as formidable as fire giants. Three weeks ago, a quartet of fire giants strode through the village, climbed over the ridge west of [[G6 - Town|town]], waded across the river, and disappeared into the [[Surbrin Hills]] without so much as a sideward glance. The villagers were left untouched, and property damage was minimal. It was clear to the Shield's residents that the giants had no interest in the village. It merely stood in their path.

## Suggested Encounter
After hearing of the fire giants' "attack" on Mornbryn's Shield, Zhentarim operatives in [[Yartar]] dispatched mercenaries to the village, offering protection. The mercenaries rode into [[G6 - Town|town]] on warhorses, acting like shining knights. The villagers welcomed them at first, but the mercenaries are proving to be more trouble than they're worth. They seem more interested in finding the lost tomb of Mornbryn than in guarding the village. The mercenary leader, Oboth Thornsteel (NE male Damaran human veteran with 90 hit points), has turned the Troll in Flames-the local inn-into his personal headquarters, with six mercenaries (NE male and female veterans of various races and ethnicities) posted outside and six more inside. During the day, the remaining twelve mercenaries round up villagers from time to time and bring them to the inn for questioning, while Oboth takes notes in a large book clad in black leather with the Zhentarim symbol imprinted on the front. Oboth suspects that someone in [[G6 - Town|town]] knows where the tomb is hidden, or knows some bit of lore hinting at its location.

Not long after the characters arrive, the mercenaries alert Oboth, who insists on speaking with the newcomers. If Oboth thinks the characters are troublemakers, he insists that they look for shelter elsewhere. If they challenge his authority, he promises them quiet accommodations in the local [[T22 - Graveyard|graveyard]] unless they do as he commands. Oboth likes to intimidate others, but doesn't like to be intimidated. He has little respect for adventurers, but he tolerates their presence if one or more of them are members or allies of the Black Network.

## Treasure
Each mercenary carries 2dl0 gp in a pouch. Oboth also wears an electrum signet ring (worth 50 gp) bearing the symbol of the Zhentarim: a black, winged snake.
