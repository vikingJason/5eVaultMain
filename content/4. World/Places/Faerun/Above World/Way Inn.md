# Way Inn
## Overview
Southeast of [[Daggerford]], the [[Trade Way]] runs right through the middle of Way Inn, a small village enclosed by a 20-foot-tall wall of mortared granite with wooden gates to the north and south along the road. A large twostory inn, also called the Way Inn, dominates the village and has long been a popular stop for weary travelers. Wealthy merchants and nobles stay here while making hunting forays into the [[Misty Forest]]. The innkeeper, Cross Wheeler (NG male Tethyrian human scout), is a retired ranger who knows the forest pretty well and has friends among the wood elves who live there.
