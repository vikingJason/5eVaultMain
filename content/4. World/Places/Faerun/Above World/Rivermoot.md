# Rivermoot
## Overview
This small village stands at the west end of the [[Rauvin Road]], where the Rauvin and Surbrin rivers meet. Rivermoot's wood-frame dwellings are built on stilts because the rivers swell during the spring and flood the ground around them. The villagers tether canoes to their cottages so that they can move about during the river's rise.
