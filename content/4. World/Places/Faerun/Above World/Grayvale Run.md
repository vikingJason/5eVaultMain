# Grayvale Run
## Overview
The trail known as [[Grayvale]] Run extends from [[Loudwater]] and eastward, following the Grayflow River, to [[Llorkh]] and beyond. The trait's name changes to the [[Dawn Pass]] where it cuts through the [[Graypeak Mountains]]. All along [[Grayvale]] Run are wagons, fences, and cottages that the stone giants of [[Deadstone Cleft]] have wrecked and flattened with rocks.

## Suggested Encounter
The characters observe three **stone giants** quietly, almost reverently, dismantling an old stone [[C - Cottage|cottage]]. One giant gathers the stones while a second one rearranges them into decorative pillars. The third giant digs holes with its hands and buries the [[C - Cottage|cottage]]'s other contents. Characters who succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence check realize that the giants are erasing all evidence of the [[C - Cottage|cottage]] and using its stones to create something artistic and timeless in its place. Once they finish, the giants move on to the next ruined homestead they find. The giants are too distracted to notice anyone watching them from a distance. If the characters confront the giants or antagonize them, the giants hurl rocks at them. If the characters flee, the giants don't pursue, opting instead to continue their work. The giants carry no treasure.
