# Turnstone Pass
## Overview
A harrowing trail threads through the cold, windswept [[Nether Mountains]]. Hill giants, orcs, wyverns, griffons, gargoyles, and other monsters make travel through Turnstone Pass perilous. Only heavily armed travelers have any hope of making it from one end to the other.
