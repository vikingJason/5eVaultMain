# Ardeep Forest
## Overview
This forest east of [[Waterdeep]] and the Dessarin River was once part of the long-lost elven kingdom of Illefarn. Now it's home to a small clan of wood elves recently arrived from Evermeet. They refuse to leave their woods, guarding relics and ruins of ages past, and they want nothing to do with the world beyond their borders.
