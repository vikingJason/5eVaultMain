# One Stone

## Overview

The spirit mound of the Sky Pony tribe of Uthgardt barbarians lies in a grove of oak trees surrounded by the tall pines of the [[Moonwood]], west of the Redrun River. The Sky Ponies' spirit mound is a two-tiered plateau. On the lower tier, cairns cover the buried remains of the tribe's honored dead. The upper tier is shaped like a sky pony (a pegasus), though the form of this feature is readily apparent only from the air. A round, 15-foot-diameter boulder planted firmly in the ground in the northeastern part of the area represents the eye of the sky pony. The boulder is covered with line engravings chiseled by an unknown hand, and it's this stone that the spirit mound's name refers to. The Sky Ponies use the stone as an altar, and Sky Pony shamans believe they can commune with Uthgar simply by touching the boulder while its surface is bathed in the light of the full moon.

A swift but shallow stream of sparkling, fresh water encircles the spirit mound like a moat, although it is by no means defensive in nature. Overlooking the stream at the northeast and southwest ends of the plateau are unpainted totem poles, the tops of which are carved to look like sky ponies with spread wings. The withered and moldering corpses of trespassers are lashed to these poles as warnings to others.

Sky Pony warriors patrol the woods surrounding the spirit mound. Adventurers are likely to encounter one or more of them as they traverse the forest (see the "[[Moonwood]]" section).

## Ancient Relic

Casting a detect magic spell on the boulder reveals an aura of transmutation magic emanating from it. The boulder itself is a relic of giantkind that was shaped, carved, and abandoned long ago by a stone giant earth shaman. Uthgar and his followers found it in its shrunken form and brought it here. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can tell that the engraved lines adorning its outer surface are carefully designed to channel magical energy. Casting an identify spell on the boulder allows one to learn its magical properties, each of which is activated by tracing specific lines on its surface:

- A creature can use an action to cast the control weather spell or the divination spell from the stone. Once either spell is cast, this property can't be used again for 7 days.

- A creature can use an action to shrink the stone to the size of a 6-inch-diameter orb weighing 25 pounds, or enlarge the boulder to its normal size (15-foot diameter) and weight (12 tons). Anything the enlarged boulder falls on takes 55 (lOdlO) bludgeoning damage. A creature can avoid taking this damage by tumbling out of the way with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Once the reducing or enlarging effect is used, this property can't be used again for 24 hours.

## Suggested Encounter

When the characters reach the uppermost tier of the plateau, the ground beneath their feet begins to tremble. Seconds later, a bulette erupts from the ground 50 feet away from them. Mounted on its back is a member of the Cult of the Black Earth named Tau (NE male Shou human). He knows the properties of the One Stone and seeks to claim the relic in the name of Ogremoch, the Prince of Elemental Earth. He do esn't want any witnesses and attacks the characters on sight. Two rounds later, on the bulette's initiative count, a second bulette mounted by a Black Earth cultist named Sharda (NE female Illuskan human) erupts from the earth and joins the fray. Tau and Sharda have the statistics of cult fanatics, with the following changes:

- These cult fanatics are neutral evil.

- They speak Common and Terran.

- They wear stone breastplates instead of leather armor, giving them AC 16.

- They wield stone clubs instead of daggers that deal 4 (ld4 + 2) bludgeoning damage on a hit.

The cultists aren't easily frightened or intimidated, but characters who capture one can attempt an interrogation. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check convinces a captured cultist to reveal that the individual is a member of the Cult of the Black Earth, which operates in and around the [[Sumber Hills]], and that the cult worships Ogremoch. These cultists have no connection to the giants; their leaders are described in Princes of the Apocalypse (see that adventure for more information).

As the battle winds down, before the characters have time to take a short rest, twenty tribal warriors and an Uthgardt shaman (see appendix C) of the Sky Pony tribe emerge from the northwest edge of the woods, having been drawn here by sounds of combat. They rush forward and attack.

## Treasure

The cultists' stone breastplates are treated with magical oil and weigh the same as metal breastplates. They are worth 250 gp each.
