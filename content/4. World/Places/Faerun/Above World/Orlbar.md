# Orlbar
## Overview
Far removed from civilization, the old village of Ori bar overlooks the confluence of the Loagrann and Grayf:low rivers and attracts only those with an adventurous spirit. The place is all but abandoned now, its few remaining shepherds driven off by the stone giants of [[Deadstone Cleft]] (see chapter 6, "Canyon of the Stone Giants").

## Suggested Encounter
Thane Kayalithica's stone giants have flattened every building in Orlbar, buried the scrap iron and lumber, and left behind piles of stones. Io their wake, a mute **stone giant** named Zorkh has begun stacking the stones in pleasing ways, creating a veritable forest of piled-up stones, some as much as 20 feet tall, on the slopes where Orlbar once stood. Six **goats** follow Zorkh around wherever he goes, eating the grass around him as he sorts through stones and stacks them. Zorkh, who lives like a hermit in the [[Graypeak Mountains]], understands Giant but can't speak. If the characters ask him how to get to [[Deadstone Cleft]], he leads them to the shore of the Loagrann River, then points in the direction of Dead stone Cleft. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check realizes that the giant is suggesting that the party follow the river. Zorkh won't accompany the characters, for he believes that [[Deadstone Cleft]] is cursed. Zorkh has no treasure but carries a sack that holds `dice: 2d4` mundane items, determined by rolling on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction.
