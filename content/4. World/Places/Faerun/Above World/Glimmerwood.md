# Glimmerwood
## Overview
Three forests grew together to form the Glimmerwood: the [[Moonwood]] to the west, the [[Coldwood]] to the east, and the [[Druarwood]] between them. The Glimmerwood's pine, fir, and spruce trees grow atop the rocky foothills and escarpments of two converging mountain ranges: the [[Spine of the World]] and the Ice Spires. The trees are more stunted and sparse as the altitude increases to the north.

**[[Moonwood|MOONWOOD]]**

This dense coniferous forest north of the [[Evermoors]] seems very quiet and still. The southern fringes of the [[Moonwood]] are home to small bands of moon elves and wood elves, as well as the rustic homes of a few woodcutters and trappers. Uthgardt barbarians and lycanthropes prowl its northern depths.

**[[Druarwood|DRUARWOOD]]**

Uthgardt barbarians of the Black Lion and Red Tiger tribes live and hunt here. The two tribes share a spirit mound in the forest's icy northern reaches (see the "[[Beorunna's Well]]" section).

**[[Coldwood|COLDWOOD]]** Branches of the Ices pear River emerge from the heart of the [[Coldwood]], trickling south toward the [[Silver Marches]]. The Glimmerwood is so frigid that the ground is covered with several inches of snow even during the height of summer. In winter, the trees are bent under several feet of snow and ice, while the ground remains navigable because of the shelter that the dense foliage overhead provides. Fire giants have used fire and their greatswords to clear wide swaths through the eastern woods, to expedite overland travel to and from [[Ironslag]]. In these areas, the stench of burned wood hangs in the air above rows of incinerated trees.
