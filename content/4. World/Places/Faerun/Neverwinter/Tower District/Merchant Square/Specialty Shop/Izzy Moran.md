Izzy Moran

Street Hustler

*“Hey, you want* *potions**? I got* *potions**, plenty of* *potions**. This one? Heals wounds and makes the next person you see lust after you. Don’t drink it now; you ain’t my type.”*

**Appearance:** A skinny guy in a cheap knock-off of the latest fashion pesters passers-by with his latest pitch.

**Roleplaying:** He’s so eager to impress that he usually uses the wrong words, and often talks himself into a corner. His hand movements and facial expressions are exaggerated.

**Personality:** A natural-born street hustler, he is always out to make a buck on the latest fad or Next Big Thing. Motivation: He chases the quick buck and likes staying out of jail.

**Background**: After a very short career in outright crime, Izzy decided that he’d be better served (and serve less time) working the gray areas of the law. Since then, he’s followed an endless string of entrepreneurial opportunities, from baby dire rabbits (“They grow up?”) to faux leather armor (“But it didn’t chafe, did it?”), usually with disastrous results. Somehow, he always survives his schemes, and manages to find a new one. Because he’s always chasing the next opportunity, he’s got a very good sense of what’s going on in the city’s underworld, and can be an excellent source of information on its vices.

**Traits:** *(KS) Business, charming, humorous, merchant*
