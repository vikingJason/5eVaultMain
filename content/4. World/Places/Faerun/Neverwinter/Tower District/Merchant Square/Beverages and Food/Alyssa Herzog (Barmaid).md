Alyssa Herzog

Barmaid

*“I’ve never been on an adventure before. Will you take me on one?”*

**Appearance:** Her auburn hair is often tied back behind her head. She wears a typical barmaid’s dress.

**Roleplaying**: Highly contemplative, Alyssa isn’t sure exactly where she wants life to lead yet, but she wants to find out.

**Personality**: She is friendly, determined, and adventurous. Her spunk is undeniable.

**Motivation**: Alyssa wants to get out and see the world.

**Background**: Life is boring for Alyssa. She is old enough to crave independence and knows she was never cut out to be a barmaid. She doesn’t know what she wants to be, but she definitely wants to find out. Last week, Alyssa was absolutely enchanted with the life of messenger girl who came into the bar. The week before that, Alyssa kept going on about all the herbs she learned about from a traveling [[T23 - Apothecary|apothecary]]. This week, who knows? Alyssa sees a lot of people come through her father’s bar, and any strong female role model instantly catches her eye. Alyssa could excel in a lot of roles. She is smart and willing, and while she might come off as flighty initially, she definitely has the follow-through to carry out a strong decision and won’t give up easily. Alyssa might latch onto one of the PCs as her new favorite person, or she might run off following someone more dangerous, necessitating a rescue.

**Traits**: *(JA) Child, entertainment*
