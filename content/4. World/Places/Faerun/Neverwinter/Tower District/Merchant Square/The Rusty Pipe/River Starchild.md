River Starchild

Interstellar Hippie

*“You’re really harshing my mellow.”*

**Appearance:** A lithe young woman, River has long blond hair down to her knees, wears floral themed jewelry, and has small, multipurpose chemical-analysis and dispenser implants.

**Roleplaying:** River always seems to be a bit under the influence of some kind of illegal substance. She smiles, flirts, and cuddles up to whoever seems the most susceptible to her charms.

**Personality:** More of a thrill seeker than an addict, River dabbles in a number of “feel good” drugs and vices and is willing to try almost anything once. She is laid-back and casual and has a difficult time taking anything seriously.

**Motivation:** River enjoys drifting along wherever the spacewinds take her, and only puts effort into getting men to give her gifts or scoring a new type of high.

**Background:** Raised in a religious orphanage, River escaped as soon as she turned 18. After dating several men, and learning how to manipulate them to get what she wanted, she met another young lady named Amber and the two became friends. Amber was a musician, and brought River along on several tours with her band. Enjoying the fast lifestyle, but not willing to actually work for it, River eventually met up with a small commune of space hippies and joined their ranks. Claiming to be religious pilgrims as a cover, they travel the stars searching for new vibes and good drugs.

**Traits:** *(MN) beautiful, charming, humorous, impoverished*
