Brynhild Skaldmeier

Honorable Mercenary

*“Gold will buy my services, but it will not buy my honor. My company will not kill the unarmed, nor take what is unearned, nor destroy homes and farms.”*

**Appearance:** Standing tall and proud, she is one of the most attractive warrior-maidens most have ever seen.

**Roleplaying:** She is honorable and professional, and sneers at cowardice or treachery.

**Personality:** Brynhild is the leader of a mercenary company, and her first loyalty is to her troops. She has a strong sense of duty and integrity.

**Motivation:** She pledges her life to fulfilling her contracts and to honoring her responsibility to her troops.

**Background:** Brynhild fled home when faced with the expectation of marriage to a pig farmer. She took up service in the military, and worked her way up the ranks. After a particularly nasty campaign where she was ordered to burn peasants’ homes and slaughter their livestock, she resigned her commission. She started her own mercenary company, only taking troops who would serve with honor (with clauses to that effect in her contracts). While many of her employers have balked at her adherence to such a strict moral code, the company is earning a reputation for effectiveness and integrity. Brynhild may respect her enemies, but she will not betray an employer nor break a contract. Brynhild is in the service of a villain, and while she is still an honorable opponent who is difficult to dislike, that makes her a villain by extension.

**Traits:** *(KS) Aggressive, beautiful, leader, military, warrior*
