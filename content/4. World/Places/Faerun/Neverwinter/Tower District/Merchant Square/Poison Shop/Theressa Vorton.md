Theressa Vorton

Scheming Poisoner

*“Little Victor looks worse...it’s clearly time for a treatment. You do have your payment?”*

**Appearance:** A sensible businesswoman, Theressa dresses in rich but practical maroon clothing. Her hair is drawn back and coiled in a black cap, emphasizing her pale skin and high cheekbones.

**Roleplaying:** She is impatient with small talk, ignoring people when they become emotional. She affects a schoolteacher’s diction, sharp and precise.

**Personality:** Theressa cares only for her own comfort, and manufactures crises in order to have the solution in hand. That some are too stupid or poor to buy her services doesn’t disturb her.

**Motivation:** This is the quickest, surest path to wealth for her skills. People don’t enjoy coming to her, but they grovel appealingly when they’re short on their payment.

**Background:** Despite learning midwifery, Theressa was shunned for her lack of compassion. She discovered a way to imbue slivers of stone with a poison that leaks out into water slowly. After developing a mastery of the antidote, Theressa packed up and headed to a larger city, leaving a few splinters of poison behind in the stream for spite. After establishing her practice in a city, she slips poison into the well, where the dilute doses sicken children first. She sells her medicine at a good profit, draining families of their savings and watching others die. Then she packs up her cure, journeys to a new city, and poisons its well.

**Traits:** *(SM) Abhorrent, business, magical, medic*
