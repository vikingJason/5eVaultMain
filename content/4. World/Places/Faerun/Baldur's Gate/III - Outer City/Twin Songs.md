# Twin Songs
## Description
A sprawl of tiny temples and shrines, where sites dedicated to dark entities such as Loviatar, Hoar, and Beshaba.

Church of Last Hope: This modest Twin Songs chapel professes allegiance to no deity, but it offers the suicidal a reverent end to life through a ritual of rev erie. Those who suffer from depression as well as the horribly ill or maimed receive invitations from temple staff, who ascribe their knowledge of those in pain to divine inspiration. The fate of the souls that pass through their hands remains unknown.
