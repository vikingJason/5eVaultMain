Shrine to Lathander

## Description

An arch of rose-hued stone, it stands on a plinth several steps above the street. By long tradition, no structures are built east of the shrine, so nothing but the city wall and the fog stands between the Rose Portal and the first rays of the rising sun.

A handful of priests of Lathander once presided over [[The Sun|the sun]] god’s shrine, which virtually all travelers and entrepreneurs visited, Many folk exchanged mar riage vows at the arch as well, passing through it to signif’ a new beginning in their lives. Since the priests’ departure. the Rose Portal has fallen from favor—but Baldurians still believe that climbing the shrine’s steps and passing through its arch bring good luck.
