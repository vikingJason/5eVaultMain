# Andar Beech
## Overview
**Gender**: Male
#Gender/Male

Andar Beech manages its day-to-day affairs in the [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]] in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate]]. Beech has misgivings about Silvershield’s involvement in politics, but the greatest sacrament to Gond is industrious labor, and Silvershield could never be accused of laziness. When civil unrest disrupts work, Beech, Silvershield, and the rest of the Gondar step up.

Beech is a devout servant of Gond who thinks that many [[III - Outer City|Outer City]] residents reject the joyful yoke of labor in favor of sinful sloth. He is art outspoken critic of [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], who he says “steals the labors of others.” He isn’t sympathetic to the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]’s citizens, either. The slender verger believes that many patriars are every bit as parasitic as [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], since they con tribute nothing while resting on the laurels of their assiduous ancestors. In Beech’s opinion, the chief difference between [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] and [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] is that [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] worsen the city’s problems while [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s members cause them.
