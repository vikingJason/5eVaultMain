# The Helm and Cloak (Inn)
## Overview
Located at the heart of the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]], just steps from the [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]] and the [[High Hall (The Ducal Palace)|High Hall]], the Helm and Cloak serves the upper crust and has prices to match. Its food is excellent, and its accommodations are sumptuous.

### The Helm
The Helm is an old rooming house that faces Chuch of Gond’s [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]]. A massive iron helmet once worn by a titan (according to the wait staff) shadows its entry.

The Helm is a fashionable place to dine and chat. Patriars and [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] residents who have lofty social ambitions favor it. Unlike other high-priced establishments, the Helm and Cloak doesn’t follow the latest fashions. Its proprietors devote themselves to providing patrons with a warm and comfortable environment in which to stay, conduct business, or have a quiet meal or drink.

Traditional good taste, plush ftirnishings, a quiet atmosphere, and attentive service keep the Helm and Cloak busy. The upscale inn and tavern consists of two connected buildings.

### The Cloak
The smaller Cloak, an old house that fronts a courtyard off Windspell Street, faces the [[High Hall (The Ducal Palace)|High Hall]]. A cloak hangs over its porch. As the story goes, a priestess of Sune once owned the house and had lurid pictures painted on its ceilings. The original cloak was hers, but many mantles of dif ferent colors and fabrics have been displayed above the Cloak’s door since then.

The Helm’s common room holds a marble unicorn bust whose bronze horn is touched for luck. The statuary is a symbol of the Knights of the Unicorn, a group of chic-younglings-turned-adventurers who used the Helm and Cloak as an informal headquarters.

The Knights are currently hiring the entire upper floor of the inn.

The Helm's cuisine is served in generous platters suitable for several ordinary people. Dishes such as fried onion-and-spiced-tubers, candied meats, jellied eels, fresh fish in hot lemon sauce, and glazed and stuffed fowl are representative of the menu at large. Most dishes are cooked in wine.

The inn’s wine cellar is vast, both in variety and in quantity. The Knights of the Unicorn have a particular taste for Saerloonian glowfire wine, and often purchase several barrels of an evening. The contents of the cellar are only sold to non-residents in smaller quantities. Also available are a mediocre variety of mead and cinnamon-spiced milk (hot or cold). No beer or hard liquor of any sort are sold on the premises, in order to prevent a tavern-like atmosphere from arising in the establishment.

The staff of the Helm are courteous, welcoming, and swift in their duties. The inn is renowned for its excellent service, especially little touches such as a warmed robe and slippers delivered to one’s room upon waking. Services include hot baths, clothes-mending, dressing assistance, and as much mint water in-room as desired. All services except for stabling and food are inclusive in the room fee.

Although noted for their courtesy and thoughtfulness, it should be noted that the staff of the Helm and Cloak will not tolerate rudeness, disruptive behavior, and especially violence. On the rare occasions when an unruly visitor refuses to quiet down, she or he is swiftly and forcefully ejected from the establishment. The inn's owners are also said to have close ties to [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] mercenary company. The establishment is widely considered one of the safest in the city.

Mead and milk are 5cp/glass. Wine is 3gp/tallglass, 10gp/greatgoblet (about 1 bottle), or 25gp/hand cask. All platters of food are 10gp/ea. Rooms range from 17-25gp/night, depending on size and location. Stabling costs an extra 3gp/night/animal (the Helm is noted for providing the finest-quality hostlery).

## Story
Rumors persist of elegantly furnished garret chambers reached by secret passages and about treasure hidden beneath the rooming-house building (attributed to long-ago pirates, naturally). The staff politely discourages inquiries on either subject

## Relationships
A husband-and-wife team from Cormyr runs the inn and its large staff with smooth efficiency. Unknown to most. Vedren and Halesta are retired members of the Knights of the Unicorn. The organization has grown far beyond its humble beginnings and now boasts members across Faerün.

After Vedren and Halesta’s adventuring party fractured, the two humans came to [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] to share a less dangerous life together. The unicorn bust is a reminder of what brought them together. Still, old habits die hard, and the innkeepers keep their ears to the street and their swords sharp.

The Helm is much favored by individuals of power in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate]]. Numerous business deals are negotiated in its dining alcoves every day. Its clientele largely fall into two categories: locals coming to dine in the festhall and well-to-do travelers coming to enjoy the elegant accommodations.

There is an entire floor set up for long-term occupancy, largely occupied at present by the Knights of the Unicorn. These Knights are romantic adventurers, commonly described as "elegant buffoons." They make pleasant if slightly absurd company for any patron with good manners and a sense of humor.
