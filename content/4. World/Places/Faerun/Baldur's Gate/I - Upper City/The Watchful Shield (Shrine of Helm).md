# The Watchful Shield (Shrine of Helm)
## Overview
**Type**: Shrine
#Location/Shrine

Shrine to Helm

## Description
In the past, Watch members, Flaming Fist soldiers, bodyguards, caravan guards, and anyone who felt the weight of a duty to protect people or things often frequented the Watchful Shield, a shrine to Helm. Since the death of the God of Guardians, however, the small chapel and its porch-like, watch-post wings have stood empty as a form ofmonument to a god who died doing his duty. Rumors persist that ghosts guard the shrine at night, but the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]] youths who visit the Watchful Shield in search of adventure typically find an angry Watch soldier instead.
