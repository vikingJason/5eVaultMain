# Seskergates
## Overview
**Type**: Building, Landmark
#Location/Building #Location/Landmark

For more than a century, this tall structure adjacent to [[Mandorcai's Mansion|Mandorcai’s Mansion]] housed the Sesker merchant family. The reclusive Osimund Sesker, the last of his line, died alone in this mansion two winters ago.

## Description
[[Imbralym Skoond]], an aspiring young wizard from Athkatla, bought Seskergates to use as his home and magic workshop. Before doing so, Skoond arranged to be introduced to [[Torlin Silvershield (Duke)|Torlin Silvershield]]. The duke imme diately saw a use for the man’s ambition and amorality and seized the opportunity to gain a completely loyal “personal wizard.”

After Skoond purchased the Seskergates man sion, popular gossip held that the gaudy manor was a perfect match for his outlandish, foreign customs. Its garishness was only part of its appeal to Skoond, though, whose real interest lay in the structure’s his tory. Entwhistle Sesker, a successful smuggler who made his home a warren of secret passages, hidden rooms, false walls, and concealed entrances and exits, built the mansion in the Gate’s early years. By Skoond’s time, all but a few of the house’s more whim sical secrets had been generally forgotten. Skoond, however, sought out the manor after reading about it in an old history of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]].

Skoond’s tall, narrow mansion is barely furnished. The wizard uses it only for sleeping and storage; he eats his meals out and spends every waking moment running Silvershield’s errands and furthering his own plots. The young peer also secretly houses several alchemists and guards in Seskergates, using an alley behind his home to cover their comings and goings.
