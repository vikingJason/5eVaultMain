#Location/Building #Location/Landmark

Temple of Tymora.

## Description
Since it was seafaring traders who founded [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], clergy of the goddess of good fortune and risktaking found fertile ground for establishing a temple to Tymora in the city’s early days. The Lady’s Hall, made of local granite, roofed with slate shingles, and featur ing a modest spire, rises only slightly above the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]’s already tall buildings. Unlike the [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]] and [[The Water Queen's House (Temple of Umberlee)|the Water Queen’s House]], this unas suming building blends nicely with the city’s other architecture.

Within the Lady’s Hall, statuary and artwork depict scenes that tell tales of pluck and luck winning the day at sea. The temple’s art has been accused of catering to the passions of seafaring Baldurians. In actuality, the Tymorans inherited both the artwork and the build ing, which had served as Valkur’s temple in the city’s earliest years. After Valkur’s priests, or wavetamers, established the temple, a series of infamous sailing disasters sparked a riot in which residents demanded that the wavetarners protect ships from Umberlee’s wrath. When another ship sank, killing all aboard it, rioters captured Valkur’s priests and threw them— bound and weighted—down the steps of [[The Water Queen's House (Temple of Umberlee)|the Water Queen’s House]]. The site of Valkur’s temple was con sidered cursed after that episode, but the Tymorans recognized a great opportunity to challenge the rumors of haunting spirits in the place, and Tymora rewarded their gamble.

Tymora’s temple might seem underwhelming, but the building is used only for religious ceremonies, which her devoted care little about. To do Tvmora’s bidding, her priests, or luckbringers, preside over much of the city’s gambling. Rather than participate, they impartially judge races, wrestling matches, cock fights, and other contests of chance and skill.

The priests work in various gambling halls and gaming establishments and run contests at city festi vals. Tymora’s luckbringers also act as talent agents for people who have exotic or exceptional abilities, and they help supplicants who need anonymous problem solvers. For various reasons, many Baldurians won’t confide in or work with [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], [[V - The Watch|the Watch]], or [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]]. So the temple fills that niche for them, = accepting requests, and large donations, to broker solu tions. Its clergy recognize the danger of stepping on [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s toes, but the priests are firm believers in the mantra “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.”
