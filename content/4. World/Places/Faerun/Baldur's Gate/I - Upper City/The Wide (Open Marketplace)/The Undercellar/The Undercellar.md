# The Undercellar
## Overview
**Urban Region**: District, Borough, Neigborhood, Other
#Urban-Region/District #Urban-Region/Borough #Urban-Region/Neigborhood #Urban-Region/Other

A cluster of chambers in a warren of storage cellars beneath the city has been used as a seedy tavern and festhall for most of the Gate’s history. Archways, some with iron-barred, lockable gates, link the cobbled, vaulted chambers of the Undercellar. At least two dozen ways in and out of the popular establishment exist. About half of them connect to other buildings. Not all are widely known, and a few are purposely kept secret.

## Description
### The Undercellar
![[undercellar.png|The Undercellar|300]]
[[undercellar.png|open outside]]

A clearly marked entrance to the Undercellar beckons on [[The Wide (Open Marketplace)|the Wide]]’s southern rim. Most Baldurians view the Undercellar as a seedy yet unique underground tavern and festhall. Its cobbled, vaulted chambers were once the storage cellars of various buildings, many of which still conduct business today. Over decades, the judi cious addition of arched doorways and freshly dug, narrow tunnels has strung the cellars together, form ing a sizable network of passageways and chambers. The Undercellar is much more than an idio syncratic festhall. Its unmapped tunnels are more extensive than most city residents imagine. Dozens of access points reach it. Most of them are unmarked, and owners and overseers of more than a few such sites purposely keep them secret. [[VI - The Guild|The Guild]] directly controls some entrances; others are privately owned but made available for [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s use in exchange for coin.

Only a few people know the whole of the Undercel lar’s pathways well enough to act as guides and only a fool would enter the jumbled, lightless spaces without a knowledgeable escort. With a guide, it’s possible to travel beneath almost the entire [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]. While neither swift nor comfortable, such a journey can be made in complete secrecy.

## Points of Interest
As a festhall, the Undercellar isn’t riotous or obvi ously bawdy. Its public areas function mostly as guarded gambling dens and dining areas in which “sociable friends” lounge, chat, and sip drinks that their suitors buy them. For private liaisons, compan ions sashay their suitors over to the Cellarers, who escort the participants to secluded quarters. Mis treatment of a sociable friend results in a Cellarer immediately whisking the victim away and deserting the offender in the perilous maze of darkness that is the Undercellar’s undercellar.

## Resources
he Undercellar is also a place of business for Alfrus Manyblades, a fly-ridden, scarred, rasping old dwarf who sells weapons to anyone; Vug Gorkul, a sophisticated, effete yet monstrously large half-orc herbalist ‘ho purveys potent rnedicaments, exotic liqueurs, and vitiating toxins; and Nasparl Nintan ter, a sardonic male half-elfwho wears an eye patch and sells disguises ranging from the simple to the elaborate.

## Relationships
The affable Heltur “Ribbons” Ribbond, a gaunt, bearded man, runs the Undercellar. Ribbons is always smiling, has never publicly lost his temper or shown fear, and throws daggers and bottles with deadly accuracy. His cadre of toughs, which everyone calls “the Cellarers,” guard the festhall. It’s rumored that Ribbons is actually a front, the fall guy in case something untoward should happen. According to gossip, a shadowy owner known only as “Tallhat” employs Ribbons. Some whisper that Tallhat is really Duke Silvershield, while others say Tallhat is the wizard Iorroakan (see page 63), or is actually Guildmaster [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]].

Several notorious characters, such as [[The Fetcher|the Fetcher]], have put down professional roots in the Undercellar and have created Guild-approved corner offices for themselves. [[The Fetcher]] is almost always in. Ribbons directs many patrons to [[The Fetcher|the Fetcher]]’s private cham ber. It’s rumored that he’s a Guild agent whose hands dance as he attends to numerous dirty strings, which happen to be attached to Baldurians in the highest and lowest of places.

## Additional Details
[[V - The Watch|The Watch]] and the Fist never police the Undercellar. Thus, the underground locale serves many unsavory characters, functioning as a meeting place for the Gate’s underbelly professionals and bottom feeders. Visitors are routine in the festhall’s popular areas, but anyone who wanders farther afield quickly runs afoul of the Cellarers. If Ribbons doesn’t recog nize someone, he pointedly questions the patron about his or her business in the Gate’s belly.
