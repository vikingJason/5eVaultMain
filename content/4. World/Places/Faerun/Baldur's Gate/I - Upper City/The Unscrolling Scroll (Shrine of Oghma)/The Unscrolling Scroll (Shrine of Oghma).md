# The Unscrolling Scroll (Shrine of Oghma)
## Overview
**Type**: Shrine
#Location/Shrine

Shrine to Oghma

## Description
The Unrolling Scroll, Oghm&s shrine, stands in stark contrast to the surrounding buildings ofyeLlow stone and slate roofs. Like the [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]] and the Hall ofWonders, its pavilion is made ofwhite marble, but its arched roof is a vibrant red outlined in gold leaf. A wide reflecting pool rests in a deep basin under its roof, and a podium for speeches projects slightly into the water. The shrineâ€™s unusual construction efficiently projects the words of a person who speaks from the podium throughout the area.
