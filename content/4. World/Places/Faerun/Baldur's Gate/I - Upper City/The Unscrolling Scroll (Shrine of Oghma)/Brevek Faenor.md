Loremaster Most High Brevek Faenor, a man in his late forties, officially oversees the shrine. For some time now, he has been lax in his duties, allowing use of the shrine to secular performers and anyone who has news to spread. Oghma is the god of knowledge, inspiration, and ideas, and the shrine was built to be a place to share such things.

However, the loremaster has had his eye oii the [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]] since he moved to [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. Thwarted in his recent attempt to gain control of Gond’s temple, Faenor can now be found studying books in Gond’s library or near the Unroll ing Scroll glumly listening to Baldurians complain about the shrine’s posted speaking schedule. Mean while, Faenor keeps his ear to the ground as he awaits another chance to gain the highest seat in the [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]].
