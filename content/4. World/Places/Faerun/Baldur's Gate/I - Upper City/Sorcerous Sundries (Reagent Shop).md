# Sorcerous Sundries (Reagent Shop)
## Overview
The tall, round building currently known as Sorcer ous Sundries has the most magnificent roof in the city, a vast dome seemingly made entirely of stained glass. Inside, arched stonework that supports the roof above the uppermost floor compromises the illusion, but its effect is impressive nonetheless.

## Goods and Services
**Goods Sold**: Consumable Item, Other ; Components for rituals and spellcasting, dubious fortune-telling and even more dubious spells of good luck or greater skill. No spells!
#Goods-Type/Consumable-Item #Goods-Type/Other

Blackhand earns a large, steady income from the import and sale of components for rituals and spellcasting, dubious fortune-telling, and evenmore- dubious spells of good luck or greater skill. Blackhand flatly refuses to sell spells, and he denies having magic items for sale. However, to keeps the rumors alive and his prices high, the wizard sends his apprentice, a gnome named Gilligunn, to contact seekers of such items and make transactions “away from the master’s eye.”

## Relationships
The wizard in residence, an aged human who calls himself Rivalen Blackhand, claims to have come from Halruaa. Blackhand says he was once capable of mighty magic before a battle with a demon blackened and withered his right hand, forcing him to end his adventuring ways.

## Background
Over the years, the structure has been employed as a residence, a clothier’s shop, a restaurant, a green house, and a flower shop. Its current owner has returned the building to its original purpose, doing business as a magic shop. The ground floor, the only area into which patrons are permitted, is awash in silk curtains, thick rugs, and luxurious furniture.

Magical symbols liberally adorn the Sorcer ous Sundries’ decor, and a sign inside the entrance assures customers that the symbols are protective in nature. The ceiling is made of multicolored glass, as are the outer rims of the structure’s upper floors. When light filters through the stories of the building, moving rays and splotches of multicolored light dance in the shop. Minor enchant ments enhance the effect, making for captivating skygazing as patrons wait for the proprietor to fetch ritual components or consult otherworldly entities.
