## Story
Leader of the city’s greatest patriar house, duke on [[I - The Council of Four|the Council of Four]], and head priest of its grandest temple of Chuch of Gond, Torlin Silvershield is one of the most power ful people in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. Decades ago, Silvershield helped defend the city during Valarken’s coup and assisted in founding the [[III - Parliament of Peers|Parliament of Peers]]. He is a descendant of the great Entar Silvershield, a grand duke at the time when Ahdel Adrian defeated Sarevok.

Silvershield sees himself as the embodiment of the best of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. As such, he takes great pains with his appearance to present a proud example for others to follow. The duke fasts for long stretches and exercises daily, giving him a gaunt but fit phy sique. His black hair has grayed at the temples, and he wears a well-trimmed salt-and-pepper beard.

The high artificer resides in the traditional Silvershield estate in the southwestern corner of the [[Manorborn]] district with Evelyn, his wife; their two daughters, Skie 11 and Alana; arid their son, Entar III. The other members of the family keep low social profiles so as to stay out of the duke’s way. Silvershield is considering quietly sending his children to Waterdeep, Selgaunt, and Athkatla, where they can be educated in any field they choose before being married in arrange ments that benefit [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]].

Torlin Silvershield believes that his nobility and birth right give him a divine obligation to rule with justice. Like many worshipers ofGond, the god of innovation and technology, the high artificer sees wealth as proof ofthe god’s favor and firmly believes in fair rewards for labor. So Silvershield never appears in public without displaying excellently crafted High House ofWonders items and jewelry. Additionally, [[The Silvershield Estate|the Silvershield estate]] is adorned in fine art and technological marvels.

The best interests of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] are foremost in Silvershield’s plans, even trumping the concerns of Chuch of Gond’s temple. The duke didn’t seek power within the temple hierarchy for its own sake, his sake, or Chuch of Gond’s sake. Rather, he viewed his religious service as the best way he could serve [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. He sees no hypocrisy in this outlook. To Silvershield, the ends always justify the means.

Thanks to a nobleman’s education and masterful control over his voice and demeanor from a lifetime of sermonizing, Silvershield is a natural diplomat and a consummate actor. The patriar is neither vain nor greedy, but he has an all-consuming drive to realize his visions for the Gate’s future, no matter the cost. He is fearless and clear-headed in a crisis, and he is always thinking at least three steps ahead.

The duke detests patriars who abdicate their duties as rulers and abet [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], and he truly despises [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] denizens who subvert the gods’ divine intent and aspire to rise above their station to meddle in the city’s governance.

In recent months, Silvershield has grown increas ingly grim and unscrupulous in his scheming. He believes that the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]]’s unchecked growth is dragging [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] down into violence and a lower standard of living. He sees all-out war against [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] as inevitable and [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s extermination as the city’s paramount task. He knows [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] has wormed its way into every aspect of city life, arranging matters for its profit and daily convenience.

Silvershield appreciates [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] but resists turning its full force against [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], because he believes that doing so would only drive [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] to strike at innocent civilians in retaliation. Instead, he believes it is time to fight fire with fire. He is on the lookout for suitable adventurers to hire to battle [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]. Such a group, provided with covert aid from the dukes and an understanding that, if necessary, the courts would find in their favor, could accomplish far more than [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] or [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]].
