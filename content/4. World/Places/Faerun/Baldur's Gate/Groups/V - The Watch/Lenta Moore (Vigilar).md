Lenta Moore serves as a Watch vigilar. She wanted to join [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]], but her elderly father, a wealthy [[I - Upper City|Upper City]] merchant and a [[III - Parliament of Peers|Parliament of Peers]] member, protested, worrying she would be “sent away to die in some desert battle in Calimshan.”

Moore commands a troop of thirty shields and three sarmars. She has a reputation as a deadly swordswoman who has killed in the line of duty.

On her shift, she oversees the inspection of all handcarts and cargoes that pass into the city through the Black Dragon Gate. Utterly incorruptible, she arrests anyone, regardless of social status, who offers or accepts a bribe within her earshot. Duke Silvershield demoted her from the rank of sword after her harsh treatment of a young patriar in this regard. (All four dukes can dismiss, recruit, promote, or demote Watch members.)

[[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]], the leader of [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], has on numerous occasions considered eliminating Vigilar Moore to make the Black Dragon Gate a friend lier place for Guild operations. She resists doing so because the vigilar’s father, Reavus Moore, is solidly in [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s pocket—and his support would certainly be lost if something tragic happened to his daughter and [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] was implicated. [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]] is now leaning toward pulling a few strings to get Lenta reassigned to a less bothersome post or promoted to a position where she can’t interfere so directly with Guild interests.
