[[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] is home to almost ninety professional guilds. Most guildhalls are located in the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]], even when their members keep shop and live elsewhere. Since the troubles involving the Iron Throne, [[I - The Council of Four|the Council of Four]] has required all guilds to acquire and maintain official charters, and it has outlawed unofficial associa tions. Such charters must be renewed every year. The three classificatioHs of charters and the divisions within them create a structure among the professional guilds based on their wealth, traditions, and members’ social status.

Those that provide goods and services to the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]] have the “Council’s Eminent Fellow ship” honorific, those belonging to the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] use the “Parliament’s Distinguished Union” honorific, and those belonging to the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]] have the “Balduran’s Honorable Company” designation. For example, the bakers, millers, and salters were granted their char ter in the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]], so they are known collectively as Balduran’s Honorable Company of Provenderers. Membership in a professional guild is mandatory in the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]], strong in the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]], and considered entirely optional in the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]]. The city’s official professional guilds are organized in the structure outlined below.

Each guild is grouped according to the classification of its honorific, and the guilds within a united group are arranged in hierar chical order from the top down within each category.

### Secret Guilds
The establishment of laws for professional guilds officially ended the public presence of the Iron Throne in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], but it didn’t spell the end for the organization. Simi larly, the Merchant’s League was originally based in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], and even though prominent patriar families such as the Irlentrees, Miyars, and Sashenstars disavowed the group, its influence remains.

Iron Throne: The Iron Throne has always focused on con trol of weapons, armor, and trade in iron. After the trouble in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] many decades ago, a crisis in its leadership led to its decline for a time. But it now secretly maintains a controlling interest in arms and armor made for [[V - The Watch|the Watch]] and [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]].

Merchant’s League: The Merchant’s League was once fully backed by [[I - The Council of Four|the Council of Four]], but its growing control over trade in the city and its failure to effectively counteract the Iron Throne caused the dukes to ban the organization. Although officially dissolved, the Merchant’s League con tinues to do business through its member families, which control the Seafarers, Traders, and Woodworkers guilds.

Knights of the Shield: The Knights of the Shield is a vast secret society to which nobles, traders, and shopkeepers belong. Members pass information that seems like it might be economically useful to other members and up the chain of command so all can profit. Its members have kept a low profile throughout the group’s existence, and they intend to keep things that way.
