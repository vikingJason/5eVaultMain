## Story
When Rilsa Rael joined [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], she had nowhere else to turn. [[IV - The Flaming Fist|The Flaming Fist]] had hanged her father for harboring her uncle when the mercenaries were after him. So her beautiful mother had become a patriar’s courtesan to support Rael. When the man’s wife discovered the trysts, she demanded that Rael’s mother be imprisoned in [[The Seatower of Balduran|the Seatower of Balduran]], where the woman wasted away and died while her lover went unpunished. Left on her own, Rael joined the gang in Norchapel, where her mixed Tethyrian and Calishite parentage and language skills gave her a natural advantage in bringing [[Little Calimshan]] fully under [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s influence.

Rael’s talent at going unnoticed and her skill with a knife earned her a position on the Lady’s Court as one of [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]]’ bodyguards—the guildmaster’s favorite, in fact. Her loyalty, ruthlessness, and inventiveness in dis creetly solving problems fueled her rise. Acknowledging Rael’s potential, [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]] removed her bodyguard from the court and installed her as [[Little Calimshan]]’s kingpin. Rael’s status as Nine- Finger’s favorite hasnt changed, making her heir presumptive to [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] leadershin.

Rael learned how to exploit others from [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]], but she does not use intermediaries and scapegoats to insulate herself from her affairs as [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine- Fingers]] does. Instead, she takes a personal hand in most matters. She moves openly through the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]] alternating between helping the poor, slinging insults at any Fist patrols moving between [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]] and the [[II - Lower City|Lower City]], and occasionally breaking the nose of a reluctant shopkeeper. She even holds a public audience at her headquarters in the Calim Jewel Emporium to hear the complaints of [[III - Outer City|Outer City]] residents.

Rael’s opinions of the Gate’s leaders and institutions were formed during her rough childhood. She thinks [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] is cruel and uncaring, and [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] are hypocritical and self-serving. She sympathizes and identifies wholly with the poor in the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]] and blames the Fist and [[VII - The Patriars|the patriars]] for the terrible conditions there—and the fact that, in her words, “The people need [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] to protect them from the city and from themselves.”
