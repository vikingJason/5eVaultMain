## Story
Few members of [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] know Fruward except by reputation. They know only that “the Nail” works for [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]], and that you’ll know him when you see him because of the nail driven right into his forehead. The three-inch-long spike has a wide, square head, the gleam of which Fruward keeps hidden under a hand kerchief he wears beneath his battered hat.

Fruward came by his strange injury due to a disagreement with members of the Builders Guild. What Fruward was told would be a late-night negotiation over work contracts in the dry dock where he worked turned out to be an ambush. He was held down, hammered in the head, splashed with ale, and then laid on his face among his tools so that his death could be called an accident.

Later that night, the young [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]] entered the dry dock to hide from a pursuing Flaming Fist patrol that had spotted her climbing out of a window. She happened upon Fruward lying facedown and heard him struggling to breathe. She turned him over to find him miraculously alive despite the nail in his head—and then Fruward awoke while his head was cradled in her hands. l’hat’s when the doors of the dry dock rattled open, and the Fist patrol entered along with Fruward’s would-be murderers. Disoriented but enraged, Fruward leaped forward, incoherently screaming accusations. A battle ensued, and Fruward escaped with his life only due to the aid of the one who would later become master of [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]].

Returning to a normal life wasn’t an option—not after killing some of [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] and his enemies in the Builders Guild—and the despondent Fruward began to wish the nail had killed him. But [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]] helped him again. She set him up with a place to live and provided him what he needed to keep going until he came to terms with his new life—as a secret member of [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]].

The Nail is unflinchingly loyal to [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]] and carries out her commands without comment. He acts as a buffer for [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]], arranging things when she would prefer that her name or [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] not be directly involved. Few in [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]] recognize Fruward after meeting him unless he reveals the nail in his forehead to them. His face is otherwise unremarkable, and the nail tends to attract the eye, so that the rest of Fruward’s features fall away from memory. Despite their close association for several years, Fruward and [[_Nine-Fingers_ Keene|Nine-Fingers]] now rarely meet. The Nail receives most of his orders by way of message spells cast by a member of the Lady’s Court.

Supervises De Zure Wrat in the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]]. He keeps a low profile while doing so.
