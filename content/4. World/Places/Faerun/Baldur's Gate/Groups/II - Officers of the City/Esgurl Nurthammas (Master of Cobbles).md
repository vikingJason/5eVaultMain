The master of cobbles attends to road and bridge con struction and the maintenance of all public stonework that is not a city wall, a drain, or an underways The post can be a lucrative one, since crafters sniffing after city building contracts are always willing to spend gold to catch the masterâ€™s attention.

Esgurl Nurthammas is young, nervous, and eager to please. He belongs to one of the poorest patriar fami lies and hopes to parlay a good record as master of cobbles into a [[III - Parliament of Peers|Parliament of Peers]] seat.
