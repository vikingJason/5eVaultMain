No laws control construction in the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]], including on the bridge spans that comprise WTyrms Crossing. Tenements, taverns, and shops heap up on both sides of these stone spans. Many cantilevered structures extend out over the Chionthar, and others loom above what has become a shadowy and crowded alley down the bridge’s center. [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]] stands between the bridge’s lengths, and land traffic must pass through [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]]’s fortress to reach the other side.

The fort leaves both drawbridges lowered until dusk, unless an enormous merchant ship in need of quick passage pays a hefty fee to have the northern drawbridge raised. A stone-lined tunnel, replete with arrow-slits, port cullises. and murder holes, passes through the fort. Before travelers can enter it, they must pay a toll. Folk on foot pay 2 cp apiece, and people traveling with a cart or wagon pay 1 sp. For 1 gp, an individual can buy a writ of passage that allows an unlimited number of crossings for a month. To decrease the chance of fraud, both a court official and the purchaser must sign the document at the time of purchase so the writ holder can be identified.

## Description
The first sign of civilization that a traveler boating on the Chionthar or coming overland from the south or east is likely to see is [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]], an impressive fort rising high above the surface of the water. Wyrm’s Crossing, the bridge that arches over the river’s slowly flowing water, connects the fort’s islet to the [[III - Outer City|Outer City]] districts ofTwin Songs to the north and Rivington to the south.

Buildings and merchant stalls, ranging from ram shackle to elaborate, pile atop each other along the entire length ofWyrm’s Crossing, making it impos sible to see the water from the narrow, congested roadway that cuts between the structures. Precariously perched establishments that hang over the bridge’s sides occasionally become unbalanced and tumble into the river. Such a structure sometimes pulls its neigh bors down with it. Anyone trapped inside a falling building cannot expect any aid.

[[IV - The Flaming Fist|The Flaming Fist]] requires that all buildings on the bridge be constructed from light timber or wattle and daub, lest one of the spans collapses under the weight of the structures it holds. However, the trade-off is that fire is a constant concern.

The bridge’s two spans extend from shore directly to [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]]. The riv er’s depth and the bridge’s high arches allow most ships to pass unhindered. However, the largest sailing vessels must pass on the northern side of [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]], where the water is at its deepest. The best time to make this passage is at night, when both drawbridges are raised, but ship captains in a hurry can request daytime passage. This special ser vice requires paying a fee to [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]], which the mercenary company splits with the city. For captains seeking to meet a deadline for a high-capacity trade mission, the inconvenience is often worth it.

[[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]] is a formidable fortress. Arrowslits dot its foot-thick granite walls, promising a stiff challenge to anyone foolhardy enough to assauh the structure from the water. The fortress occupies most of the islet, leaving only the narrowest shelf between its sheer walls and a plunge into the river below. The area’s near-constant rain and river currents have worn smooth the islet’s sides, which are almost always slick with algae. Attempting to scale the small island while under attack from the fort’s archers would be a suicidal endeavor.

When the drawbridges are raised, the only way to enter [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]] is by climbing up a steep set of exposed stairs to a staunchly barred sally port. And spotting its tiny jetty, which is set below a long, steep, and exposed set of stairs, is a challenge at a distance. No roadway around the fort exists; all traffic look ing to cross to the other side of the bridge must pass through the fortress’s guarded tunnel. A painted board featuring the emblem of [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] hangs above the tunnel’s entrance. The tunnel dominates the forts first floor and is one long gauntlet of murder holes and arrow-slits. Several offices and chambers that support toll collecting and provide some comfort to the guards complete the tower’s first floor.

The second floor of [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]] is an [[B9 - Armory|armory]] well stocked with oil, rocks, javelins, arrows, and other implements designed to kill invaders. Guests on their way to the second floor are warned to watch their step, lest they break an ankle stepping into a murder hole. (This warning is just entertainment for bored guards; all the murder holes are kept covered under normal circumstances to prevent such accidents and to keep travelers from dropping trash through them.) Above the [[B9 - Armory|armory]] are the officers’ and enlisted mercenaries’ quarters. A shooting gallery encircles each level of barracks. In a pinch, X’Vvrm’s Rock could uncomfortably garrison about a hundred soldiers. Typ ically, between twenty-five and fifty mercenaries are present here.

Below bridge level in [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]], a highceilinged dungeon is used as a storeroom. It holds provisions and a dozen canoes, in case soldiers need to launch a quick maneuver or counterattack along the river. The dungeons have a holding area for prison ers that use wall-attached manacles. The only reason someone might be held in this location would be in the case of a riot or fire making travel across the bridge too dangerous. This situation most recently occurred in the aftermath of Duke Valarken’s failed coup. Dis guised patriar sympathizers were captured as they tried to leave the city. Since the mob on Wyrm’s Cross ing was out for blood, the prisoners were held in the dungeon until they could be spirited out the sally port and sailed to [[The Seatower of Balduran|the Seatower of Balduran]].
