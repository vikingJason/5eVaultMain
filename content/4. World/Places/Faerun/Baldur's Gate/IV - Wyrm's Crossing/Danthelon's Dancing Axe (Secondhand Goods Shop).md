## Story
A flying, animated, double-bladed axe that obeys only Danthelon is said to guard the shop at night. The proprietor tells anyone willing to listen that a grateful elf princess who was also a peerless sorcerer gifted the axe to him while he was on a daring adventure. The truth is a lot less romantic.

The “dancing axe” is an illusion-cloaked, tamed stirge. Danthelon looses the creature when he closes the shop. Appearing as a double-bladed axe, the stirge can be glimpsed through the cluttered windows of the shop as it flits around the darkened interior. The tw’o crammed floors of Danthelon’s shop con tain items that an adventurer might need, including empty barrels and cages of all sizes,just-for-show armor, peddler’s carts, folding boats with oars, and large lanterns fitted w’ith candles the shopkeeper guar antees w’ill burn for an entire day and night. Danthelon’s has a third floor and an attic, both of which are occupied by a tenant, Yssra Brackrel. The half-elf is small and gaunt, and looks as if she might be starving. She has glittering eyes, disheveled black hair, and a habit of humming to herself Fierce “Yes!” and “No!” whispers punctuate her wordless tunes.

Brackrel advertises herself as a makeup artist and hairstylist; a sign dangling from the stairs that run up the front of Danthelon’s building says as much. Brack rel has those skills and often uses them to maintain her charade, but she makes her real living as a wizard for hire, and is often in [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]’s employ.
