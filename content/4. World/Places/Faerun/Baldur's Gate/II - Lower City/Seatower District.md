## Description
A causeway from this neigbourhood connects to [[The Seatower of Balduran|the Seatower of Balduran]]. The tower affects nearly every aspect of district life. Many of its residents are Flaming Fist members who prefer the comfort of apartments or family homes ashore to the spartan barracks of the Seatower. Many masters and veteran members of Parliament’s Distinguished Union of Metalworkers operate shops in the Seatower district, making it the best place in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] to shop for high-quality weaponry and armor at fair prices.

The high population of soldiers in the Seatower district has inspired its thick concentration of taverns, festhalls, and gambling parlors. These businesses are clustered along the river, as far from the Old Wall and the trendy streets of [[Bloomridge]] as possible. On nearly every Flaming Fist paydayc Seatover becomes the Gate’s most boisterous corner, and Flaming Fist officers field a profusion of complaints about noise and brawling from their [[Manorborn]] and [[Bloomridge]] neighbors.
