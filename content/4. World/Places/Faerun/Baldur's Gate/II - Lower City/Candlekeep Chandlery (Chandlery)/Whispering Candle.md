A speciality item sold in the [[Candlekeep Chandlery (Chandlery)|Candlekeep Chandlery]] in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate]]. The item is sold by Marcella Idra.

Costs at least 25 gp for a very short message (including the whispering service recorded at the shop).

## Profile
This item has a fire mephit magically trapped in its tallow. As the candle burns, the mephit continually voices back whatever sounds it heard while the tallow was being prepared, in the voice of the speaker. Different voices can be recorded in different candles, so that when they are all burned they can make the sound of a conversation or musicians playing together.

Many people find this feature both charming and useful. Whispering candles are popular at patriars’ galas; one candle burning at the entrance can welcome guests as they arrive, and many can be placed around the wings of a ballroom to whisper pleasant reassur ances or create an air of mystery. [[V - The Watch|The Watch]] uses whispering candles with imbedded commands to time its shift changes. It has long been a fashion among patriars to record their wills in whispering candles.

The candles are also appreciated by those who need to communicate discreetly. Many use whispering candles to communicate with agents, spies, and secret lovers. The chandlery has a secure room where messages can be whispered through a speaking tube into the boil ing tallow’. Once a candle is formed, the only way to release the message (and return the mephit to its home plane) is by burning the candle normall) If the candle is destroyed—smashed underfoot, for example, or tossed into a fire—the message can’t be recovered, even if the tallow is re-formed into a new candle.  Candles that contain vocal performances by noted bards or readings of epic poems are popular items in the shop. Idhra also carries a small line of novelty candles that unexpectedly utter the roar of an owlbear, for example, or some embarrassing sound. The price of a whispering candle depends on its size, the circum stances of its recording, and the beauty of the candle itself The smallest and plainest whispering candles, which burn for only a minute, cost 25 gp. Grand and complex arrangements of candles, such as the operatic chandelier employed at the cotillion ball of Duke Sil vershield’s daughter, cost several thousand gold pieces.
