# The Blade and Stars (Inn)
## Overview
This inn is named for its unusual signboard, an enchanted shield that was looted from a ruined village in Amn following an old trade war. A circular piece of wood painted black, its front displays a curved silver saber and a female’s pale, slender arm whose long fingers grip the hilt of [[Delborggan|the blade]]. The enchantment on the shield, still strong after decades of hanging out in all weather, causes glimmering motes of light to wink on and off as they travel across the saber. Many local legends have sprung up about the shield’s power and the saber depicted on it, but the inn’s proprietor insists that the illusion of “stars” is the shield’s only magic. Meanwhile, the shield still does what the inn’s founder intended it to do when she brought it back and hung it above the door: It draws business.

The interior of [[Delborggan|the Blade]] and Stars is an unremarkable yet comfortable inn. Lacking a tavern and a dining room, the long, tall building is filled with bed rooms and small apartments in which travelers can stay for fair prices and have food and drink sent up to them. Many of the rooms have private balconies over hanging the street, providing visitors with a great place to stay while watching the city in full sw’ing. Because eating requires renting a room, locals avoid [[Delborggan|the Blade]] and Stars unless they need space for a pri vate gathering. The inn’s current proprietor, a Turmian female named Aurayaun, is happy to rent rooms for a few hours, provided that the renters also place a large order of food and drinks.
