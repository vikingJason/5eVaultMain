## Description
[[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] has one of the largest, busiest harbors on Faerun’s western coast. The city’s independent status and tolerant nature appeal to many sea captains, who settle their families in [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] homes. As a result, the Gate handles a wide variety of cargoes. Many pirates looking to fence their latest prizes also regularly tie up in the Gate.

Visitors are often impressed by the harbor’s sheer size and level of activity, marveling at its seventysix enormous cranes and its scoops and cargo carts, which run on rails of steel along the docks and make loading and unloading an efficient process. The dock equipment is operated by Balduran’s Honorable Com pany of Harborhands. but the priests of Chuch of Gond devised and built it. Thus. Chuch of Gond’s [[High House of Wonders (Temple of Gond)|High House of Wonders]] receives 1 cp out of each fee paid for the use of a cart or a crane. All fees and ship manifests are taken to the Harbormaster’s Office, a tiny building with thick walls and barred windows that stands apart from other city structures.

[[The Water Queen's House (Temple of Umberlee)|The Water Queen’s House]] is also a solitary struc ture. It dominates the end of a pier and descends on one side into the harbor. Waves have lapped against this temple of Umberlee for generations. Sailors and their families make frequent small offerings at it to buy the Bitch Queen’s favor. Its priestesses can often be seen descending the temple’s outside staircase to walk offerings into the river, where they disappear beneath the waves and climb back up empty-handed. What happens to the offerings is a mystery no one in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] has ever dared to investigate, and the wrath of the whole city would surely fall upon anyone who did.
