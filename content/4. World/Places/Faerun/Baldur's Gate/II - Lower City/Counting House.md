# Counting House
## Overview
**Type**: Facility, Building
#Location/Facility #Location/Building

The Counting House has stood as a center of trade and business in the city for centuries. A thick-walled and heavily guarded edifice on the waterfront, it serves as the primary location for exchange of currency and valuation of gems and jewelry. Its owner, a stern and aloof dwarf named Rakath Glitterbeard, holds the key positions of treasurer for the Council’s Eminent Fello’.vship of Financiers and is also the kingpin in the Steeps for the lawless Guild. Loans and other debt markers, both legal and other wise, that he holds make certain no one in the city dares to challenge Rakath’s positions or attempts to rob the Counting House.
