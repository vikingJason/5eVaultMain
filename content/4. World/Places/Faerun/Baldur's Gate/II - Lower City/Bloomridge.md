## Description
[[II - Lower City|Lower City]] citizens generally lead a working-class existence, but successful merchants, ship captains, landlords, and others who have access to wealth try to live as much like patriars as they can. Rich folk sometimes purchase several [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] buildings, or even small blocks, and either raze the structures or modify and connect them to form a palatial home. Slightly less prosperous folk typically rent expensive, upper-floor apartments, preferring locations that feature rooftop terraces or balconies that offer fine views.

These impressive homes are mostly found in Bloomridge, a fashionable [[II - Lower City|Lower City]] district dotted with cafes, flower shops, and artisan boutiques. The districtâ€™s main street runs steeply up from the harbor to the Old Wall. Numerous structures have exterior staircases and open terraces built into or against the wall.
