### Overview of Lower City

## Description
The Lower City, a great crescent of steep slopes descending to the docks, is packed tight with conjoined, slate-roofed buildings that are made of stone and fea ture window boxes and stout shutters in vibrant hues. The Lower City’s narrow alleys access interior court yards and other streets. Stone buttresses often span its roadways, literally holding apart the upper floors of structures that face each other. Even though some of these narrow supports act as pedestrian bridges, they are most often used by pigeons, gulls, rats, and cats. Lower City citizens are accustomed to their noisy, cramped existence. As the long-ago sage Asturgel of the Gate wrote, “In the Lower City, we live and work atop each other untidily.”

Trade is king in this section of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. Craftwork, repairs, and buying and selling consume the lives of the tradesfolk, shopkeepers, and day servants who dwell here. Commerce in shops and crowded streets begins before sunrise and continues until after dark. By day, each shop’s shutters are flung open. At night, they’re firmly fastened shut, regardless of w’hetber their windows have iron gratings. Aside from inns and taverns—which are open, well lit, and employ “trusties” to guard against vandals, drunkards, arson ists, thieves, and brawlers—the Lower City is largely dark and shuttered after sundown.

### Dark and Foggy Streets
Since the damp clings to the entire city, the Gate’s cobbled streets are typically slick underfoot. When traction becomes a real problem, the locals spread straw or river gravel on the cobbles to help folk find their footing.

Communally maintained streetlights dot various crossroads and light the darkest spots beneath the Lower City’s many stone support arches. Oil-andwick copper bowls, whose copper wing reflectors direct radiance, partially illuminate the Lower City's nicer districts. Glassless, tin candle lanterns throw light into its rougher neighborhoods. Both types of lighting are solidly constructed and mounted. Citizens who live near the lanterns light them at dusk and, if wind or rain have not yet extinguished them, blow them out at sunrise.

The open doors of inns, taverns, and late-to-close cafes spill some light into the streets, but most folk carry lamps or hire lamp lads and lamp lasses. These youths carry many-candled lanterns on long poles and, for a few coppers, guide customers through the streets at night.

## Points of Interest
### Gray Harbor
[[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] has one of the largest, busiest harbors on Faerün’s western coast. The city’s independent status and tolerant nature appeal to many sea captains, who settle their families in Lower City homes. As a result, the Gate handles a wide variety of cargoes. Many pirates looking to fence their latest prizes also regularly tie up in the Gate. Visitors are often impressed by the harbor’s sheer size and level of activity, marveling at its seventysix enormous cranes and its scoops and cargo carts, which run on rails of steel along the docks and make loading and unloading an efficient process.

The dock equipment is operated by Balduran’s Honorable Com pany of Harborhands. but the priests of Gond devised and built it. Thus. Gond’s High House ofWonders receives 1 cp out of each fee paid for the use of a cart or a crane. All fees and ship manifests are taken to the Harbormaster’s Office, a tiny building with thick walls and barred windows that stands apart from other city structures.

[[The Water Queen's House (Temple of Umberlee)|The Water Queen’s House]] is also a solitary struc ture. It dominates the end of a pier and descends on one side into the harbor. Waves have lapped against this temple of Umberlee for generations. Sailors and their families make frequent small offerings at it to buy the Bitch Queen’s favor. Its priestesses can often be seen descending the temple’s outside staircase to walk offerings into the river, where they disappear beneath the waves and climb back up empty-handed. What happens to the offerings is a mystery no one in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] has ever dared to investigate, and the wrath of the whole city would surely fall upon anyone who did.
