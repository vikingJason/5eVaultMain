#Location/Area #Location/Point-of-Interest #Location/Building #Location/Landmark

The Flaming Fist maintains two bastions in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]] and the Seatower of Balduran. If [[Wyrm's Rock|Wyrm’s Rock]] is a symbol ofthe Fist’s unbreakable strength, then the Seatower is a symbol of its stature and success.

## Description
The Seatower serves [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] as headquarters, barracks, naval base, prison, and fortress. The marshal and most of the officers responsible for day-to day Fist operations typically work from the Seatower.

Its well-stocked [[B9 - Armory|armory]] houses longswords, short swords, cudgels, chainmail, bows, thousands of arrows, pots of [[2. Mechanics/Classes/Artificer/Alchemist|alchemist]]’s fire, other assorted tools for waging war and policing the streets, and plenty of stone ammu nition for the Fist’s three parapet-mounted trebuchets. A stone flung from atop the Seatower, with the added impetus ofgravity behind it, is almost guaranteed to crash clean through any wooden-hulled ship it strikes. A capstan at ground level in the tower can raise a mas sive chain from the riverbed and stretch it taut across the harbor mouth from the Seatower to deep pilings under the easternmost wharf in Brampton. When the chain is raised, nothing bigger than a rowboat can sail into or out of the harbor. Except for drills and maintenance checks, the chain has not been raised for decades.

The last time the chain was raised for defense was to protect against a veritable fleet of Calishite ships. Fishermen and merchants arrived in the evefling warning of a flotilla heading upriver, many of the ships flying Calishite flags. The dukes, having heard reports of war in the south but not having been informed by any dignitary of Calimshan’s need to use the river, feared invasion. When the ships arrived just after sunset, the chain had been pulled up across the harbor, and ships full of Flaming Fist soldiers floated just beyond it with catapults and flaming arrows at the ready. They needn’t have bothered. The ships held no Calishite warriors,just refugees from the war. When the dukes determined the truth of the matter, the chain was lowered and the refugees were allowed into [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]]. Citizens didn’t repel them as invaders, but neither did they make the Calishites welcome. The incident set the tone for relations between the refugees and the people of [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], and led to the found ing of the separate settlement of [[Little Calimshan]].

The Seatower is an impressive architectural work looming over the bay. It erupts from a rocky islet in the harbor in such a way that attackers approaching by boat will find few footholds at the tower’s base. Five stout towers provide firing lines along all the Seatower’s walls and away from the islet in all directions. Specially made Gondar trebuchets atop the towers can fire thrice the distance of a normal siege weapon, allowing hurled stones to reach atop the cliffs on the opposite side of the river (or even into the [[I - Upper City|Upper City]]), although such shots must be calculated and “made blind” due to the low elevation of the Seatower.

A 400-foot-long causeway connects the Seatower to shore. No gate or drawbridge along the span exists; its length alone is considered sufficient defense, since attackers would be exposed to archers and missile fire along their entire approach. If enemies come to Bal dur’s Gate, [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] wants them to attack the Seatower, believing that the sooner they do, the sooner they’ll be defeated.

The Seatower houses about a hundred Flaming Fist soldiers on a rotating basis, billeting them in levels of the towers not given over to the prison and in the two buildings within the bailey. These buildings are the [[B9 - Armory|armory]] and the officers’ tower. Although small caches of gear and weapons exist throughout the Seatower for ready access, the [[B9 - Armory|armory]] holds most of [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]]’s hoard of war-making materiel. The underground rooms beneath the [[B9 - Armory|armory]] are a virtual museum of every conflict in which [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] has engaged. Everything from elephant barding to snowshoes can be found somewhere in the depths of the [[B9 - Armory|armory]], all of the items carefully cata logued and regularly maintained.

A small section on the first floor is set aside as a gallery. There, on racks and in cases, rest the tro phies of battles lost and won: Duke Eltan’s sword and armor; a coral trident taken from a leader of the ltzcali sahuagin; a tattered flag from Fort Beluarian: Kings car, the massive sword of Sothillis the ogre king of Murannheim; and more. The [[B9 - Armory|armory]] also holds the Seatower’s kitchens and larder.

The smaller officers’ tower serves as the quarters for the marshal and a temporary billet for officers ofvari ous raiks. There, the marshal frequently speaks with the officers of current events or plans campaigns. In addition to meeting areas and private rooms, it holds a collection of books and scrolls in a library that the offi cers can use to study tactics, consult maps, and review contracts. Beneath the officer’s tower are [[IV - The Flaming Fist|the Flaming Fist]] coffers, in a lead-walled vault separated by yards of solid stone from any other underground area. None but the highest-ranking officers knows exactly where the door to the vault can be found and what the secret is to opening it.

The Seatower’s least glamorous role is as the local prison. Long-term incarceration isn’t common, but plenty of people need to be locked up for a few days, tendays, or months. Three levels of dungeon extend beneath the Seatower. The two lowest are below the harbor’s water level, so they are always frigid and damp. The uppermost dungeon level is divided into small cells that hold one to five prisoners each. The lower levels consist of two large cells apiece. Under normal conditions, no more than twenty-five prison ers are housed together in a large cell. If the situation calls for it, however, up to ten times that many can be crammed cheek by jowl into each of those chambers.

The causeway connects the Seatower of Balduran to the city’s [[Seatower District|Seatower district]]. The tower affects nearly every aspect of district life. Many of its residents are Flaming Fist members who prefer the comfort of apartments or family homes ashore to the spartan barracks of the Seatower. Many masters and veteran members of Parliament’s Distinguished Union of Metalworkers operate shops in the [[Seatower District|Seatower district]], making it the best place in [[1. Story World Almanac/Forgotten Realms/Toril/Faerun/1 - World Above/Baldur's Gate/Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]] to shop for high-quality weaponry and armor at fair prices.

The high population of soldiers in the [[Seatower District|Seatower district]] has inspired its thick concentration of taverns, festhalls, and gambling parlors. These businesses are clustered along the river, as far from the Old Wall and the trendy streets of [[Bloomridge]] as possible. On nearly every Flaming Fist payday Seatover becomes the Gate’s most boisterous corner, and Flaming Fist officers field a profusion of complaints about noise and brawling from their [[Manorborn]] and [[Bloomridge]] neighbors.
