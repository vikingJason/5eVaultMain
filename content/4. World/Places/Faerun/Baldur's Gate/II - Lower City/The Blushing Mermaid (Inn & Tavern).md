# The Blushing Mermaid (Inn & Tavern)
## Overview
[[The Blushing Mermaid (Festhall)|The Blushing Mermaid]] is a noisy establishment whose clientele is known to break into brawls over a spilled mug, a funny look, or an ugly face. It’s infamous throughout the Sword Coast as a place to do illicit business. Baldurians often warn travelers against visit ing [[The Blushing Mermaid (Festhall)|the Blushing Mermaid]] unless they’re well armed, know how to use their weapons, and bring plenty of like-minded, trusted friends.

The fare prepared at the Mermaid is simple and filling. It’s all decent except for a vile stew based on pickled fish. Many sailors order crusty nutbread rolls with thick gravy ladled over them or handwheels of cheese. The Mermaid also serves raw fish on woodei platters, a tradition its chef (born in [[Kara-Tur]]) brought to the tavern. Its house beer is a thick sea ale that’s more bitter than most tongues find enjoyable. The establishment also serves stout, a Mintarn lager, and whiskey strong enough to strip paint from wood.

## Relationships
Most of the Mermaid’s patrons are old, scarred sea dogs who whittle away the day and night nurs ing drinks and swapping tales. Each one is a contact for this or that cabal, thieving brotherhood, smuggler, bandit group, fence, panderer, or some other shady dealer. Some work for [[VI - The Guild|the Guild]]. Negotiations with such contacts begin with a palmful of silver to loosen one’s memory. If such a contact pushes a tankard toward a visitor during an interview, the sea dog is looking for a refill, but not of ale.

## Background
[[The Blushing Mermaid (Festhall)|The Blushing Mermaid]] consists of a confusing maze of wings and oddly interconnected floors. It has at least four levels of cellars. Its rooms are lowceilinged, dingy, and furnished with mismatched, secondhand items. Its windows have iron bars on the outside and heavy wooden shutters with wooden bars on the inside. Patrons are told, “The boards are there to use. Management is not responsible for losses of any kind, including life and limb.”

Not many people actually sleep in [[The Blushing Mermaid (Festhall)|the Blushing Mermaid]], since raucous bar fights are liable to erupt at any hour. The lobby is the only high-ceilinged room in the place. A life-sized, crudely carved, wooden mermaid hangs above the reception desk. A score or more shriv eled, blackened hands are nailed to the mermaid’s bod5According to the staff, “ Folk who forgot their coin purses donated ‘em.”
