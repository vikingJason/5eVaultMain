# The Smilin' Boar (Cafe)
## Overview
The Smilin’ Boar was once a failing tavern, until its new owner, Jentha Allinamuck, took advantage of its [[Bloomridge]] locale to convert it into a trendy cafe. The enterprising halfling knocked down a wall to create harbor-view seating. She bought and demolished an adjacent street-front shop and installed a veranda whose comfortable and colorful dinette sets are almost always filled.

Allinamuck kept the old tavern’s name and its rude sign of a grinning boar mounting a sow. To play up the silly sign, the proprietor has stocked her cafe with tea and coffee mugs in the shape of pigs’ heads and crafted a menu whose light appetizers have names such as sow’s delight, three pigs in a blanket, and corkscrew sausage.
