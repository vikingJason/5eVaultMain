Bordered between Erradirn and Borfaldor to the West, The Tides of Darborg to the East.

The Kingdom is mainly covered in barren lands and has a warm climate, which has lead to a thinly spread population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in small towns.

Their flag has two horizontal and 1 vertical stripe in dark brown, black, light bronze and white. Their coat of arms is a spear with two swords on either side

Built upon a famines, strength, and bitter struggles of its past, this state is now among the most dangerous countries in [[Kaedimoor]].

Their survivability, abundance of precious stones and prowess on the battlefield  are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately they lack in clean water and literacy.

The United Tribes of Oshnog is a republic of tribes ruled by a War Chief with constant challenges to his power, but he has not been defeated in combat by any challenger.

However, the current greatest threat to the nation is an animal disease, but the current leadership is incapable to solve this issue.

The people of Oshnog are are content. They lead hard lives and while access may be lacking, their strength in battle helps relieve most of their issues.

Religion holds much importance in their lives and, if anything, has made them more has made them more warry of strangers. The people of Oshnog are also spiritual however and they, but they do have intriguing rites of passage and strict rules.
