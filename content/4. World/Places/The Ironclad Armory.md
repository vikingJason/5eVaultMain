> [!abstract] **Description**
> **Exterior:** The Ironclad Armory stands as a testament to the art of smithing, with its imposing stone structure and large iron anvil sign above the entrance. The clang of hammer on metal echoes through the streets, drawing in warriors and adventurers alike. The walls are adorned with intricate metalwork and weapon displays, showcasing the craftsmanship within.
>
> **Interior:** Inside, the armory is a hive of activity. The air is thick with the smell of hot metal and the rhythmic sounds of smithing. Weapons of all kinds line the walls, from swords and axes to more exotic blades. The central forge glows brightly, casting a warm light over the entire shop. Shelves hold an array of metal ingots, tools, and half-finished projects.

> [!abstract|background-color-purple]  **Staff**
> Hrothgar Stonefist is a towering dwarf with a long, braided beard and a muscular build. His skin is weathered from years at the forge, and his eyes are sharp and focused. He wears a heavy leather apron over his sturdy clothes, and his hands are calloused from endless hours of work.
