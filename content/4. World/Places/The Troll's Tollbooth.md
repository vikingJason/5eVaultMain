> [!abstract] **Description**
> **Exterior:** The Troll's Tollbooth is a quaint, two-story building made of sturdy oak wood, with a thatched roof and a sign depicting a troll collecting coins at a bridge. Ivy climbs up the walls, and colorful flowers in window boxes add a homely touch. A wooden porch with a few rocking chairs offers a view of the bustling street.
>
> **Interior:** Inside, the tavern is warm and inviting, with wooden beams overhead and a stone hearth crackling in the center. The walls are adorned with old maps, paintings of legendary adventurers, and various trinkets collected over the years. The air is filled with the scent of roasting meat, fresh bread, and the tang of spiced ale. The floor is worn but clean, with wooden tables and benches arranged in a cozy layout. A staircase in the back leads to a second floor where the guest rooms are located.

> [!abstract|background-color-purple]  **Staff**
> Martha Underbough, a cheerful halfling with curly auburn hair and a perpetual smile, runs the tavern with a motherly air. She bustles about, serving customers and keeping the atmosphere lively. The staff includes two human barmaids, Freya and Lila, who are efficient and friendly, and a burly dwarven cook named Brogar, whose food is famous throughout the region.

> [!abstract|background-color-blue]  **Patrons**
> The tavern is frequented by a mix of locals and travelers. At one table, a group of dwarves enjoys a hearty meal while discussing mining prospects. Nearby, an elven bard strums a lute, adding a melodic backdrop to the tavern's hum. A pair of human merchants negotiate quietly in a corner, while a lone adventurer sharpens his blade by the fire. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with occasional bursts of laughter and the clinking of mugs.
