The Dragon Lord was an infernal bounty hunters, tireless in his pursuit of their quarry across the multiverse.

The Dragon Lord is infamous for his sharp senses. Because he can become invisible at will, his foes are often unaware of being hunted until the Dragon Lord strikes. This invisibility can be disrupted when the devil is attacked, however, so a strong counterattack is often the best defense against it.

The Dragon Lord values the challenge of the chase and the thrill of one-on-one combat above all else.
