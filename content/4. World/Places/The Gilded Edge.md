> [!abstract] **Description**
> **Exterior:** The Gilded Edge’s exterior is a work of art, featuring a stone façade engraved with detailed depictions of legendary battles. Above the heavy oak door, a golden sign shows a sword slicing through a shimmering star, reflecting the sunlight and drawing the eyes of passersby. Wrought-iron latticework adorns the windows, offering a glimpse of the gleaming weapons within.
> **Interior:** Inside, the shop is warmly lit by enchanted sconces that cast a golden glow over polished mahogany floors. Weapons of all types are displayed on velvet-lined walls, each one meticulously organized by type and rarity. The gentle hum of magic can be felt in the air, as customers browse in quiet reverence. In the back, a small forge is visible, where an apprentice hammers away at a glowing blade.

> [!abstract|background-color-purple]  **Staff**
> Master Aric Valtoris, a middle-aged human with a wiry frame and streaks of silver in his hair, oversees the shop with a calm, authoritative presence. His hands bear the scars of a lifetime spent forging and enchanting weapons. An apprentice, a young dwarf with a determined expression, works diligently at the forge in the back. When players enter, Aric greets them with a nod, his eyes gleaming with curiosity.
