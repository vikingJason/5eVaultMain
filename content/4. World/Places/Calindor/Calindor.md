## Rules of the Fey Courts

1. **Speak no falsehoods*****
A Fey cannot tell lies. Words have power in the Feywild, and for a Fey creature to lie about the nature of a thing would be akin to insulting the thing itself. However, this does not mean that a Fey will not engage in falsehoods. Instead, they will tend tell incomplete truths and rely on the listener's willingness to deceive themself.
To circumvent this, a fairy can be asked the same question three times in succession. This will bind the fairy to answer earnestly, but will often provoke their ire and cause them to manipulate their answer by changing the circumstances.

2. **Keep all promises**
Breaking a promise would be akin to speaking a falsehood. Promises are sacred pacts among Fey that must be followed, though Fey will often manipulate the circumstances to ensure that they do not have to abide by the promise's intent.

3. **Don’t harm outsiders**
A Fey cannot harm outsiders. However, usually Fey creatures operate under differing definitions of what "Harm" entails, and often have conditions that allow them to stop regarding strangers as "outsiders".



## Rules for Fey Dealings

1. Choose your words carefully.
2. Never share your full name.
3. Always pay your debts and don’t return more than you borrowed.
4. Don’t accept gifts and never thank the Fey.
5. Do not eat Fey Food or drink Fey Wine when uninvited.
6. Don’t give Fey cheap clothing.
7. Don’t mention that you have a newborn child at home or speak the names of children.
8. Don’t step into a fairy ring.



1. **Never say 'Thank you' to them.** This phrase is taken as you are indebted to them, instead say 'I'm grateful', etc.
2. **Never, ever accept a gift from a Fey.** Or rather, one should be very careful with any gift that they are given if the giver is a Fey. If a person doesn’t trust the Fey who gave them the gift, it’s best to destroy it as strange new fey never give gifts without expecting something. And _**never, ever**_ verbally say thank you for a gift. It implies that the receiver owes them something, like a food, your firstborn, or a favor (no matter how deranged).
3. **Never lie to a Fey.** The Fey hate liars that are not other Fey.
4. **Always keep your word when dealing with a Fey.** The Fey hate cheats or those who cannot keep their word that are not other Fey.
5. **The Fey hate dirty water.** In Calindor one should never dump dirty water outside without warning any Fey (visible or otherwise) to move first, this could save your life or just save you from mischief.
6. **Never brag about any interaction that you may have with them.** A good example of this is the Brownie. The Fey like privacy and secrets, if you can't honor either of those you are likely to be targeted for bad interactions with them that may endanger your life or mildly inconvenience you.
7. **Don't spy on them or capture their likeness without their permission.** This is considered highly rude even taboo to the Fey and they hate it.
8. **Never give them your name (Full or otherwise).** Anyone who knows of the Aymm Rhoin, or Elven Naming Ritual knows that names are powerful seals and hold power, especially to a Fey. If a Fey asks for a humanoid's name and they say it, they’re giving them power (and possibly partial control) over them. The best thing to do in this situation is to give the faerie a made-up name or a nickname. However, if the humanoid knows _their_ name and say it, they can possibly bind the Fey in service to them or make the Fey leave them alone.
9. **Never accept food or drinks they give you.** Eating Fey food or drink (which is normally enchanted) will do one or both of two things. First, assuming that a person is in the Realm of the Fae, Calindor then eating their food (or drink) will bind the person to that world and force them to stay there. Second, eating their food will make a humanoid no longer hunger for human food. Which means that the person will both starve unless they are taken care of by the Fae and never be able to return to a normal life.
10. **The Fey hate Iron. Don't carry Iron on you unless you want them to avoid you.**
11. **Never stand in a Fairy Ring.** Fairy rings are the rings of mushrooms that sometimes grow where a tree has died, and they’re also portals that highly powerful Fae have created to the realm of Calindor. So standing in them is a rather stupid idea. Even if a person is not teleported, they could get stuck in the ring, and time moves much slower in there. Centuries could pass outside, while seconds pass inside. And if a person is transported to Calindor, they could be treated as their guest, or they could become their prisoner. Once someone eats the Fae’s food they’ll never be able to leave. In the worst (perhaps best case scenario) they will outright kill you for stepping in the ring.
12. **Never be rude to a Fey, always be respectful and polite.** Being inhospitable and selfish are frowned upon among the Fey. It is critical to meet their standards while in their presence. Punishments (especially in Calindor) for not doing so range from being pricked with sharp weapons for spying, to being given seven years of lameness for laziness, to drowning in a bog for being a bully. **One must be polite when dealing with the Fey at all times, with one exception. (See rule #1)**
13. **Honey can save your life.** All the Fey love honey, if you find yourself in trouble with a Fey, they may let you off the hook if you offer them some.
