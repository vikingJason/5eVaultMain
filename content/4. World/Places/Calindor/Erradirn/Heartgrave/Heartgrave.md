## Description

Scrantonia is an island of rolling hills, lush forests and storm-wracked seas. The island is populated mainly by humans and though they are not native to this island, they hold dominion overall and look down on not only the large population of [[2. Mechanics/Bestiary/Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes/Tortle|Tortles]], the native inhabitants of Scrantonia but of all the other [[races]] that can also be found here.

Scrantonia is ruled over by a Grand Marshal, appointed by the Emperor himself, from the City of Wonard, who commands the Forward Armies of the [[2. World/Places/Altai Ursa/Mundari Difflin Empire/Mundari Difflin Empire]]. 

While life is generally peaceful under Grand Marshal Mott, opinion is divided about Grand Marshal Mott Sichael and the [[2. World/Places/Altai Ursa/Mundari Difflin Empire/Mundari Difflin Empire]] itself.
 
There has been a growing rise in religious fanaticism with a sect of the followers of Deveron wanting to rid the world of all that it considers to be sinful, establish a religious sanctuary and a return to the ways of Deveron.

Not only this but there has been a growing sentiment of civil unrest, constant protests, thankfully only some of them are violent.
