> [!abstract] **Description**
> **Exterior:** The Iron Arms stands at the edge of Petalwood, a small, remote village nestled in the heart of the Verdant Vale. The shop is a humble, sturdy structure built from local timber and stone, with a thick thatched roof. A simple copper sign hangs above the entrance, engraved with the symbol of a hammer crossed with a sprig of ivy. The sound of metal striking metal can often be heard from within, mingling with the soft rustling of leaves in the surrounding forest.
>
> **Interior:** The interior of the smithy is warm and welcoming, with a large hearth in the center where the forge burns brightly. The walls are lined with tools, metal ingots, and various items in different stages of completion. A thick workbench dominates one side of the room, cluttered with projects, while shelves hold an assortment of finished goods, from simple tools to finely crafted knives and small decorative items. The air is tinged with the scent of burning wood, hot metal, and the earthy aroma of the forest outside.

> [!abstract|background-color-purple]  **Staff**
> Lerendrie Silkban is a tall, broad-shouldered woman with skin tanned by years of labor and long, braided chestnut hair that falls over her shoulder. Her eyes are a deep green, the color of the forest that surrounds the village, and her hands are calloused from years at the forge. She wears a leather apron over her simple, practical clothing, and a faint sheen of soot and sweat marks her hard work.
