> 
> As you approach Oakheart Carpentry, the first thing that strikes you is the rich aroma of freshly cut wood wafting through the air, mingling with the faint scent of pine resin. The shop itself is a charming sight to behold, nestled amidst a grove of towering oak trees whose leaves rustle softly in the breeze. The exterior of the building is constructed from sturdy oak beams, with intricate carvings adorning the doorframe and window shutters. Above the entrance, a sign crafted from polished wood proudly displays the shop's name, "Oakheart Carpentry," in elegant script.
> 
> Upon entering the shop, you're enveloped in a warm and inviting atmosphere. Sunlight filters through the windows, casting dappled patterns of light and shadow across the wooden floorboards. The interior is a symphony of textures and colors, with shelves lined with polished wooden crafts and intricate carvings displayed throughout the space. The air is filled with the sounds of saws buzzing and hammers tapping as craftsmen ply their trade, while the faint scent of sawdust lingers in the air, evoking memories of countless hours spent in the woodshop. A large workbench takes center stage, cluttered with tools and half-finished projects, while in the corner, a cozy seating area invites customers to linger and admire the craftsmanship on display.

> **`=link(this.ownerName)`** is an automaton crafted from rich mahogany and gleaming brass, standing tall and imposing behind the counter. Their form is sturdy and well-built, with joints that move smoothly and silently as they go about their tasks. Despite lacking facial features, Timber exudes a sense of warmth and hospitality, welcoming customers with a gentle nod of their wooden head.

> When the players walk in, Timber is meticulously sanding down a piece of oak lumber, their skilled hands moving with precision as they shape the wood into a beautifully carved chair.
