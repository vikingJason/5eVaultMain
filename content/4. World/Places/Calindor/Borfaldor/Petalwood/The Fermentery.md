> [!abstract] **Description**
> **Exterior:** The Fermentery stands out with its large oak barrels mounted above the entrance, with copper piping winding its way from the roof down to the doorway. The building is constructed from sturdy stone with a slate roof, and ivy creeps up the sides, adding a touch of nature to the industrial aesthetic. A sign with an intricate design of a flask and vine hangs prominently above the door.
>
> **Interior:** The interior is warm and inviting, with the rich aroma of fermenting grains and aging spirits filling the air. The walls are lined with shelves holding bottles of various shapes and sizes, each filled with a different hue of liquid. A long wooden counter runs along one side of the room, behind which Llerwyn can often be found tending to his craft. The room is softly lit by lanterns hanging from the beams, casting a golden glow over the polished wooden floors and the copper stills that gleam in the corner.

> [!abstract|background-color-purple]  **Staff**
> Llerwyn is an energetic and slightly eccentric elf with long silver hair tied back into a ponytail and bright green eyes that sparkle with enthusiasm. He wears a leather apron over his well-worn clothes, and his hands are often stained with various ingredients.
