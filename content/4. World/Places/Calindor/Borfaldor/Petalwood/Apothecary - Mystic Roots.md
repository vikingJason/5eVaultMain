# `=this.title`
> [!info|bg-c-purple] Description
> Run by an eccentric gnome named Althea Thornblossom, this enchanting establishment specializes in crafting herbal remedies and potions.
> 
> The exterior of the shop bears the telltale signs of neglect, with peeling paint and weather-worn signage that creaks in the breeze, while the once-lush garden now lies overgrown and unkempt.
> 
> Inside, shelves are sparsely stocked, the air heavy with the scent of dried herbs and cobwebs cling to the corners, a testament to the shop's dwindling clientele.

> #### Owner
> **`=link(this.ownerName)`** is a gnome with a weathered appearance and a perpetual look of concern etched onto her face. Her once vibrant green eyes now carry a hint of weariness as she struggles to keep her shop afloat. Despite her hardships, Althea remains determined to provide her customers with the remedies and potions they need, pouring her heart and soul into every concoction she creates.
