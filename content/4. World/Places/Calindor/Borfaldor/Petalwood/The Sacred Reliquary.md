> [!abstract] **Description**
> **Exterior:** The Sacred Reliquary is a modest, stone building with a weathered wooden sign bearing its name and a painted image of a radiant halo. The exterior is adorned with climbing ivy and stained glass windows depicting various saints and holy figures. A small bell above the door jingles softly as customers enter, adding to the tranquil ambiance of the Holy District.
>
> **Interior:** Inside, the store exudes an air of solemn reverence. The scent of incense and aged parchment fills the air, mingling with the faint aroma of beeswax candles. Shelves and display cases are lined with carefully arranged relics, each accompanied by a handwritten note detailing its supposed origin and significance. The lighting is soft, provided by strategically placed candles and oil lamps, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. A small altar at the back of the store, adorned with flowers and offerings, serves as a place for quiet reflection and prayer.
