## Description


The Kingdom of Erradirn is a large country with a huge population of [[Aasimar]], [[Dragonborn]], [[Genasi]], [[3. Mechanics/Races/Goliath|Goliath]], [[Halfling]], [[Human]]

Bordered between Kiduzia to the West, Borfaldor to the South, Oshnog to the East and The Abyss of Cressano to the North,

The Kingdom is mainly covered in grasslands and has a calm climate, which has lead to a localized population, despite the number of people, which means most of them live in huge settlements.

Their flag has two vertical stripes and a circle in dark gold, light brown, light bronze and dark brown. Their coat of arms  is a castle under a key.

Built upon a rare resources, wisdom and sacrifices of its past, this state is now among the most self-sufficient countries in [[Kaedimoor]].

Their medicine, education and scientific advancements are among its current greatest strengths. Unfortunately they lack in export and sustainability.

The Kingdom of Erradirn is a kingdom ruled by a monarch with power transferred to the 2nd born child, the first becoming the Protector of the Realm.
There is growing opposition against the current form of power transition, with many suspicious deaths amongst those that play the Game Of Houses.

However, the current greatest threat to the nation is underworld gangs and illegal drug trade, but the current leadership is incapable to solve this issue.

The people of Erradirn are are content. They live fine lives and while exports may be lacking, their easy access to medicines helps relieve most of their issues.

Religion holds very little importance in their lives and, if anything, has made them more cynical. They aren't very spiritual either and they rely more on science and what they know will work.
