The First Floor of the tower as they open door you see a statue over 20 feet tall, depicting a great Vedalken Wizard made of gold standing with one arm extended holding a large amulet in her hand in the centre, as if channelling her magic through the Amulet of the Great Hall. The statue is very detailed and it almost appears as though her hair are all made of individual strands of gold . 


The wizard depicted in the statue is Nedress Cardonel, a famous historical figure who helped found the Pillar of Light and was skilled at making powerful magical items. (Nedress actually created the Amulet of Vurdos)



They meet a small Goblin [[Gloralk]] in brown robes and a scar over his left eye, who happily tells them about Nedress - he is bids farewell and leaves to head to his workshop where he is working on a magical item of his own [[Pearl of Power]]


After Imrodel Galathaniel leaves, they are approached by a tall female Elf with a bald head and red eyes. She has smooth, pockmarked, blueish skin and wearing a silver silken cloak over bright blue low cut dress

You enter a room that has obviously been torn apart by a massive explosion, windows shattered, the walls and ceiling completely destroyed. 

The smell of burned wood fills the air as ash still blows about as you can spot the debris scattered throughout the room, furniture and books in disarray and a number of coloured crystals amongst the mess.

In the far corner you see what appeared to be a giant fire with purple flames. Now that you can see it clearly, you see purple flames giving off an intense radiant glow, however it does give off any heat. Inside the fire you see a circular shape made out of a shimmering, iridescent material.

As you peer into the portal, you would be greeted by a searing, red-orange light that would seem to emanate from deep within the portal. The light would be blinding and would make it difficult to see what lies beyond, but as your eyes adjust, you would begin to make out a landscape of fire and brimstone. The ground would be made of dark, volcanic rock, and would be covered in a thick layer of ash and cinder.

In the distance, you would be able to see towering spires of blackened stone, which seem to reach up to the sky. You would also be able to see hordes of twisted, demonic creatures milling about, their eyes glowing with an eerie, red light. 


You can see that portal is connected by a beams of energy to 2 conduits on either side.

The conduits appear to be a type of information storage device that uses crystals to channel and focus magical energy.

It is a very complex and intricate device, each of them have a control panel made of polished, dark wood, and  inlaid with intricate patterns of gold or silver. You see a variety of levers, buttons, and dials.

Along the bottom you see 4 empty slots.

They would emit a bright, radiant light and would be surrounded by a pulsing aura of magical energy.
