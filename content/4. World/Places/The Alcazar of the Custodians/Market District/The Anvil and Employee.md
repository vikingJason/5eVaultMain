The Anvil and Employee is smithry with an attached shopfront. The smithy is fastidious, with a swept floor and tools stored neatly on the walls. There's a desk in the corner with a piece of parchment showing the current project's measurements, and the materials are neatly stored in bins. Clearly, whatever apprentice has been charged with upkeep of the smithy has taken their job very seriously. You can see that activity in The Anvil and Employee is extremely busy. There is a blacksmith currently reading a book titled 'A Handmaid's Tail: a collection of short stories by notable Tieflings'.

On the bench lies a warhammer. It's obviously amateurish. Barbena moves around the shop, unsure of herself, betraying her lack of skills.
