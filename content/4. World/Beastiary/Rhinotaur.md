# **Rhinotaur**

<br>

> [!info|bg-c-purple] Overview
>
> The Rhinotaur is a fearsome creature that combines the strength and durability of a minotaur with the powerful horn and hide of a rhinoceros. Found in remote and untamed regions, it serves as a formidable guardian and an intimidating presence in its domain.

<br>

> [!recite|txt-Center] **Physical Description**
> The Rhinotaur stands about 9 feet tall, with a robust, muscular body. Its upper half is that of a rhinoceros, featuring a thick, grey hide and a large, curved horn. Its lower body resembles a minotaur's, with powerful legs and hooves. The creatureâ€™s tail is long and tufted, adding to its imposing silhouette.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Mannerisms/Behaviours**
> Rhinotaurs are highly territorial and aggressive when their domain is threatened. They often charge at intruders with little warning, using their horn and hooves in battle. Their movements are heavy and deliberate, causing the ground to shake as they move.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Abilities**
> Rhinotaurs possess immense strength, allowing them to deliver devastating charges and crush opponents with their hooves. Their thick hide provides substantial protection against physical attacks, making them difficult to injure.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Social Structure**
> Rhinotaurs are solitary creatures, preferring to remain in their own territories rather than forming groups. They establish and fiercely protect their domains, often being the sole ruler of their domain.

> [!recite|title-Centre] **Origin**
> Rhinotaurs are believed to originate from ancient, wild lands where the energies of the Feywild and Material Plane intersect. Their unique physiology is thought to be a result of these mystical influences.
