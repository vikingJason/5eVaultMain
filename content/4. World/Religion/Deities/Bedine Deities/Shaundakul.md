Shaundakul, the Treacherous Lurker In The Sands, is the mischeivous, malicious trickster of the desert. He appears as a jackal-headed man, but corresponds in powers to the deity Beshaba. He blinds folk, causes oases to dry out, travelers to lose their way, and so on.

Shaundakul is blamed by [[The Bedine|the Bedine]] for all misfortune. His servants, the capricious Windghosts of the desert, are actually mad watchghosts (detailed fully in The Ruins of UnderMountain boxed set, and described in the Anaurian Adventures chapter of this book).

## Profile
Shaundakul (pronounced SHAWN-da-kul), the Rider of the Winds, is the Faerûnian lesser deity of traveling and travelers, exploration, caravans, the wind as well as mining and miners. Recently, Lord Ao gifted him with the portfolio of portals and portal-walking. He manifests bodily as a bearded man who wears a traveler's cape and is armed with a greatsword called [[I - The Sword|the Sword]] of Shadows. (from Forgotten Realms Wiki)

## Story
Shaundakul is an old deity, once an intermediate deity popular in the Moonsea, whose divine status predates the creation of Beshaba and Tymora from Tyche. Shaundakul's church collapsed and his followers dwindled in the aftermath of the fall of Myth Drannor, and he dwindled in status to the rank of demipower. Beshaba later used his name to promote discord among the nomads of Anauroch, who now curse him as the Treacherous Lurker in the Sands.

Since the Time of Troubles, Shaundakul has risen back to the level of lesser power, due to Waukeen's absence during which some of her followers turned to Shaundakul. He has allied himself with deities such as Akadi, Mielikki and her allies, Selûne, Tymora, and the more daring members of the Seldarine. He opposes Shar because he dislikes secrets and enjoys spreading the word of hidden places. He battles with Beshaba for the suffering she has inflicted in his name.

## Motivation and Philosophy
*"Spread the teachings of the Helping Hand by example. Work to promote him among traders, especially trailblazers who seek out new lands and new opportunities. Unearth and resanctify ancient shrines of Shaundakul. Ride the wind, and let it take you wherever it blows. Aid those in need, and trust in the Helping Hand. Seek out the riches of the earth and sea. Journey to distant horizons. Be the first to see the rising sun, the mountain peaks, the lush valleys. Let your footsteps fall where none have tread."*

## Relationships
The goddesses Beshaba and Shar are in opposition to Shaundakul.
